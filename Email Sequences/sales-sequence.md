## Email 1: Day 0 (Launch Day)

**Send Timing:** Morning of launch (8am EST)

**Subject:** One fractional SEO slot available (March 1 start)

**Preview Text:** 10 hours/month senior execution. $8K retainer. 6-month minimum. Details inside.

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem + Solution

**Email Body:**

I just wrapped a 12-month engagement with a SaaS company. They hired a full-time SEO lead, which was the plan from the beginning. That frees one retainer slot starting March 1.

What this engagement includes:

10 hours/month of senior-level SEO execution. No junior strategists, no account coordinators, no handoffs to people who weren't on the sales call. Monthly 60-minute strategy sessions recorded and delivered with action items. Async Slack access with 24-hour weekday response time. Quarterly deep-dive audits covering technical foundation, information architecture, content performance, and competitive positioning. Living documentation in **Notion** that you own when the engagement ends.

What this engagement does not include:

Content production. I don't write 50 blog posts per month. I tell you what topics to target, how to structure the content, and where to place internal links. Your team or agency writes.

Link building. If you need scaled outreach, hire a specialist. I advise on link-worthy content strategy and digital PR angles, not manual link acquisition.

Technical implementation. Your dev team handles code changes. I identify priorities, write the requirements, and review the implementation.

If you need someone to "do SEO for you," hire an agency. If you need senior strategic guidance to direct your existing team, that's what fractional delivers.

Who this works for:

$5M-$50M revenue. B2B, SaaS, or professional services. In-house marketing team with 2+ people who can execute recommendations. Previous agency experience—you've already learned what bad looks like. Willing to commit $8K/month for 6 months minimum.

Who this doesn't work for:

Companies under $3M revenue. Teams with zero execution capacity. Anyone expecting rankings in 30 days.

How it works:

Book a discovery call: b2bvic.com/calendar (30 minutes, no pitch)

If we're aligned on scope, timeline, and working style, I send a proposal within 48 hours. Month 1 starts with diagnostic audit + implementation roadmap. Months 2-6 focus on implementation oversight and strategy adjustments based on performance data.

One slot available. I cap clients at 5 total. Currently at 4/5 capacity.

## Email 2: Day 2

**Send Timing:** 48 hours after launch (8am EST)

**Subject:** What $8K/month actually buys you

**Preview Text:** Agency math vs. fractional math. The numbers nobody shows you.

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem + Agitation

**Email Body:**

You've seen SEO agency pricing. $5,000-$10,000/month retainers. Sounds similar to my $8K/month rate. The similarity ends at the invoice amount.

Typical $5K agency retainer breakdown:

12 billable hours per month allocated to your account. 70% of those hours staffed by junior strategists or coordinators with 1-3 years experience. 30% staffed by senior strategists who also manage 15-20 other accounts. You're one of 40-50 active clients in their portfolio. Communication happens through scheduled monthly calls and PDF reports that nobody reads after the first slide.

Effective senior attention: 3.6 hours per month.
Effective cost per senior hour: $1,389 (hidden in blended rate).

My $8K fractional retainer breakdown:

10 hours per month of my time. No juniors. No coordinators. No account managers scheduling check-ins to justify their role. You're one of 5 clients maximum. Communication happens via async Slack—faster than scheduled calls, documented for your team, no calendar coordination overhead.

Effective senior attention: 10 hours per month.
Effective cost per senior hour: $800.

You pay 42% less per hour of senior attention and get 3x more of it.

Why I cap at 5 clients:

I work 8am-5pm at JAG managing their real estate database operations. Fractional consulting runs 7pm-10pm weeknights plus occasional weekend strategy sessions. That's 15 hours/week, 60 hours/month. At 10 hours per client, 5 clients maxes capacity at 50 hours/month. The remaining 10 hours handle async Slack responses, proposals, and admin overhead.

If I took on 10 clients, I'd be running an agency. Agencies optimize for revenue scale by hiring junior staff and billing at senior rates. I optimize for client outcomes by capping volume.

The math favors fractional when you need strategic guidance, not execution volume. If you need 40 hours/month of content production and link building, hire an agency with the team to deliver it. If you need 10 hours/month of senior direction to multiply what your existing team produces, fractional gives you better economics.

Discovery calls open through Friday. Currently have 3 scheduled.

## Email 3: Day 4

**Send Timing:** 96 hours after launch (8am EST)

**Subject:** 12 months of fractional SEO: The full results

**Preview Text:** +74% organic traffic. +162% keyword rankings. Here's what 120 hours delivered.

**PASAIDA Element:** Solution + Authority

**Email Body:**

The SaaS client whose slot just opened agreed to share anonymized results. Twelve months of fractional SEO consulting. 120 total hours of my time. Here's what changed.

Starting point (March 2025):

18,000 monthly organic sessions. 340 keywords ranking in top 10 positions. Blog content production running at 8 posts/month with no topical clustering strategy—articles published chronologically without internal linking architecture. 6 years of legacy content accumulated without information architecture. Conversion rate from organic traffic to qualified demo requests: 1.2%.

Ending point (February 2026):

31,400 monthly organic sessions (+74%). 890 keywords ranking in top 10 (+162%). Blog restructured into 8 topical clusters with clear pillar-support hierarchy. Internal linking overhauled—high-traffic pages now average 18 internal links pointing to them (was 4). Conversion rate from organic: 2.8% (+133%).

Revenue impact: $847K additional pipeline attributed to organic channel over 12 months (based on their $28K ACV and qualified demo close rate).

What I did with 120 hours:

Month 1-2: Technical audit + information architecture redesign. Identified 89% of traffic concentrated on 6% of pages. Discovered high-traffic pages were underlinking while low-traffic pages received most internal link equity. Designed URL restructure and topical clustering strategy. (22 hours)

Month 3-5: Internal linking implementation oversight. Reviewed their content team's execution weekly. Caught 3 significant errors that would have broken link equity flow. Adjusted priority sequencing when their dev team had limited bandwidth in Month 4. (18 hours)

Month 6-8: Topical content strategy + cluster buildout. Defined 8 pillar topics based on competitive gap analysis. Created content briefs for 47 supporting articles. Reviewed final drafts for SEO alignment before publication. (26 hours)

Month 9-11: Conversion optimization for high-traffic pages. Collaborated with their product marketing team on CTA placement, above-fold content, and demo request friction reduction. Traffic was growing—conversion rate needed to keep pace. (20 hours)

Month 12: Final audit + handoff documentation. They hired a full-time SEO lead. I documented all processes, systems, and ongoing priorities in **Notion** so the new hire could maintain momentum without starting from zero. (14 hours)

Ongoing across all 12 months: Monthly strategy sessions + async Slack guidance. Answered 200+ questions about prioritization, edge cases, and implementation decisions their team couldn't resolve internally. (20 hours)

What the client did:

Executed internal linking changes (their dev team). Wrote content following topical cluster strategy (their content team). Implemented conversion tests (their product team). Maintained **Google Search Console** monitoring (their marketing manager).

I didn't write content. Didn't build links. Didn't code anything. Provided strategic direction, identified high-leverage opportunities, and held the team accountable to implementation timelines.

That's what fractional delivers: Senior guidance without senior salary. $96K for 12 months of fractional vs. $140K+ for a full-time SEO lead with equivalent experience.

If this engagement model fits your situation, book a discovery call. One slot left for March 1 start.

## Email 4: Day 6

**Send Timing:** 144 hours after launch (8am EST)

**Subject:** "But can't I just hire an agency?"

**Preview Text:** Yes. Here's when that makes sense (and when fractional wins).

**PASAIDA Element:** Incentive + Objection Handling

**Email Body:**

I've done 6 discovery calls since Monday. Three objections came up multiple times. Here's how I answered them.

Objection 1: "Can't I just hire an agency for similar cost?"

Yes. Agencies are the right choice when you need execution volume—40+ hours/month of content production, scaled link building, technical implementation, or media buying alongside SEO.

Agencies have junior staff who can handle repetitive tasks at lower effective rates. If your bottleneck is "we need more content published," an agency team of 3-4 people can produce volume that a single fractional consultant cannot.

But if your bottleneck is "we're producing content that doesn't rank" or "our organic traffic flatlined despite publishing 20 articles/month," the problem isn't volume. It's strategy. Agencies optimize for execution metrics (deliverable counts, hours logged) because that's what their business model incentivizes. Fractional optimizes for outcome metrics (traffic growth, conversion lift) because that's what retention depends on.

The question: Do you need more execution or better direction?

Objection 2: "Why not hire a full-time SEO lead?"

If you have $140K+ budget for salary plus benefits plus equity, and you have 40+ hours/week of SEO work to fill, hire full-time. You'll get a dedicated resource who builds institutional knowledge, coordinates across departments, and owns the channel end-to-end.

Most mid-market companies ($5M-$50M revenue) don't have 40 hours/week of SEO work yet. They need strategic guidance 10-15 hours/month—audit their current state, build a roadmap, review implementation, adjust quarterly based on data. Fractional fills that gap at 70% the cost of full-time.

Three of my past retainer clients have scaled from fractional to full-time hires. When they reached that point, I helped write the job description, interview candidates, and onboard the new lead. Fractional isn't permanent—it's the bridge between "SEO matters but we can't justify a headcount" and "SEO is driving enough revenue to warrant dedicated leadership."

Objection 3: "What if results don't materialize in 6 months?"

SEO takes 90-180 days to move metrics. If you're expecting Page 1 rankings in 30 days, we're not aligned on how the channel works.

But here's the accountability mechanism I build into every engagement: Monthly strategy sessions include explicit metric reviews. We track organic sessions, keyword movement, conversion rates, and revenue attribution from Month 1. If traffic isn't trending up by Month 4, we diagnose why together—implementation delays, competitive dynamics shifting, technical issues that weren't visible in the initial audit, or strategic gaps I missed.

If the strategy failed, I adjust. If execution failed, we address resourcing. Either way, you're not flying blind for 6 months hoping something works.

I don't guarantee rankings. Nobody ethical does—Google controls the algorithm, not consultants. What I guarantee is senior-level strategic attention and honest accountability conversations.

Still on the fence? Book a discovery call anyway. Worst case: 30 minutes of free SEO advice. Best case: We identify a high-leverage opportunity and start working together March 1.

## Email 5: Day 8

**Send Timing:** 192 hours after launch (8am EST)

**Subject:** March slot filled (waitlist now open)

**Preview Text:** Thanks for the interest. Here's what happens next.

**PASAIDA Element:** Deadline

**Email Body:**

The March retainer slot filled yesterday. Signed a 6-month engagement with a B2B professional services firm. I'm now at 5/5 client capacity.

If you were considering a discovery call and didn't book, here are your options.

Option 1: Join the waitlist.

The next available slot opens in May when a current 6-month contract concludes. Email me at victor@b2bvic.com with "Waitlist" in the subject line. I'll notify waitlist subscribers 30 days before the slot opens. Waitlist members get first access to discovery calls before I announce to the broader list.

Option 2: Project-based engagement instead of retainer.

If you can't wait 2-3 months for a retainer slot, consider a one-time project:

**Enterprise audit + implementation roadmap: $12,500.** 3-week turnaround. Full 4-layer audit (technical, IA, content, competitive) plus prioritized roadmap with 90-day milestones. You get documentation, not ongoing oversight—but the roadmap gives your team enough direction to execute independently.

**AI content system buildout: $15,000.** 4-week turnaround. Local LLM deployment, custom prompt engineering for your brand voice, quality assurance workflows, and training for your content team. Reduces AI content production costs by 60-80% while improving output quality.

**Information architecture overhaul: $10,000.** 3-week turnaround. URL restructure strategy, internal linking architecture, topical clustering framework, and 301 redirect mapping. Designed for sites with 3+ years of accumulated content debt.

Projects don't include ongoing oversight, but they give you a strategic foundation while you wait for a retainer slot.

Option 3: DIY with support.

Use the 4-Hour Audit Template you downloaded. Run your own audit. If you get stuck on prioritization or need a second opinion, book a one-off strategy call: $500 for 60 minutes. I'll review your audit findings, critique your roadmap, and give you implementation guidance.

Not as comprehensive as a retainer, but better than flying blind.

Thanks to everyone who booked discovery calls this week. Even if we didn't move forward, I hope the 30 minutes gave you clarity on what "good" SEO consulting looks like—and what to demand from whoever you hire next.

## Email 6: Day 11

**Send Timing:** 264 hours after launch (8am EST)

**Subject:** What to do while you wait

**Preview Text:** If you're on the waitlist, do these 3 things now to hit the ground running.

**PASAIDA Element:** Incentive

**Email Body:**

You're on the waitlist for the next fractional retainer slot (May availability). Here's how to use the next 2-3 months so we can skip Month 1 diagnostics and start executing immediately.

1. Run the 4-Hour Audit yourself.

Use the template you downloaded. Even if implementation waits until we start working together, the audit surfaces where the biggest opportunities are. When the retainer begins, I'll review your findings instead of starting from scratch. You'll have context on your site's constraints that makes our strategy sessions more productive from Day 1.

If you haven't run the audit yet, block 4 hours this week. Layer 1: technical crawl. Layer 2: information architecture. Layer 3: content performance. Layer 4: competitive gaps. Time-box each layer to 60 minutes. Document findings in a shared doc or **Notion** page I can access later.

2. Export 12 months of Google Search Console data.

I'll need historical performance data to establish baselines and identify trends. Export page-level and query-level data for the last 12 months. Save it in a spreadsheet with these columns: Page URL, Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Position, Date Range.

This baseline shows what's working before we make changes. Without it, we're guessing at impact instead of measuring it.

3. Document your current SEO process.

Even if it's informal. Write down: Who chooses content topics? How do topics get prioritized? Who writes, who edits, who publishes? Who handles technical SEO issues when they surface? What's your internal linking process (if any)? Who monitors **GSC** and **GA4**?

When we start the retainer, I'll audit your workflow alongside your site. Strategic guidance that ignores operational constraints doesn't ship. I need to know who does what so recommendations fit your actual team capacity.

Bonus: Dig up old agency audits.

If you have previous SEO audits sitting in Google Drive from agencies or consultants you've worked with, find them. I'll review during Month 1 and extract any high-value recommendations that were buried under 200 other items or de-prioritized because implementation was inconvenient.

Timeline:

March-April: You complete preparation work (audit, data export, process documentation).
Late April: I notify waitlist, discovery calls open.
May 1: Retainer starts for qualified leads.

Questions about preparation? Reply to this email.

## Email 7: Day 14

**Send Timing:** 336 hours after launch (8am EST)

**Subject:** Still interested in fractional SEO?

**Preview Text:** Quick check-in before I close the waitlist for this launch window.

**PASAIDA Element:** Action

**Email Body:**

You signed up for the retainer waitlist two weeks ago. Quick check-in before I finalize the list.

Are you still interested in a fractional SEO retainer starting in May?

If yes: No action required. You'll receive an email 30 days before the slot opens with discovery call scheduling. Waitlist members get 72 hours of priority access before I announce to the broader list.

If no: Reply "Remove" and I'll take you off the waitlist. No hard feelings. Business priorities shift. Maybe timing doesn't work anymore. Maybe you found another solution. Either way, you'll stay on the monthly newsletter unless you fully unsubscribe.

If you're unsure: Reply with your questions. I'll answer directly. Common questions I've received this week:

"How do I know if I'm ready?" — If you have an in-house marketing team that can execute SEO recommendations and organic traffic is underperforming relative to your content investment, you're probably ready. If you're a solo founder with no marketing support, solve that constraint first.

"What if my budget changes before May?" — Discovery calls are non-binding. If budget shifts, tell me on the call. We can discuss project-based alternatives or delay until the following slot opens.

"Can you hold a spot for me?" — No. Slots fill based on discovery call outcomes, not reservations. But waitlist members get first access, so your odds are better than general list subscribers.

Between now and May, I'll send monthly emails with implementation content:

Case studies from current retainer clients (anonymized metrics, strategic decisions, lessons learned). Deep-dives on information architecture, AI content systems, and local SEO operations. Tool workflows and scripts I use for audits and competitive analysis.

These emails help you evaluate whether fractional consulting fits your business model before you commit budget. If you decide it's not the right model after reading the content, you'll know before the discovery call—not after signing a 6-month contract.

Thanks for your interest. Talk soon.
