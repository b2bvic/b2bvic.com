## Email 1: Day 0 (Immediate Delivery)

**Send Timing:** Immediately after opt-in

**Subject:** Your audit template is here (and why it works)

**Preview Text:** Most SEO audits optimize for deliverable weight, not action clarity. Here's the alternative.

**PASAIDA Element:** Problem

**Email Body:**

Your template link: [NOTION_TEMPLATE_URL]

Video walkthrough: [LOOM_VIDEO_URL]

You downloaded the 4-Hour Audit Template because you're done paying consultants $20K for PDFs that collect dust in Google Drive. The audit industry runs on a dirty incentive: complexity justifies invoices. Agencies optimize for perceived value (400-page deliverables, color-coded matrices, executive summary decks) because thickness sells. You don't need 80 hours of analysis. You need 4 hours of diagnosis and a roadmap you can execute this quarter.

Run your first audit this week. Time-box each layer to 60 minutes. When you catch yourself going deeper, stop. You're optimizing for thoroughness instead of action. The goal isn't documenting every broken link and missing alt tag. It's identifying the 20% of fixes that unlock 80% of the traffic opportunity.

Two calibrations:

If your site has under 500 pages, skip Layer 4 (Competitive Moat Analysis). You don't have the content volume to compete on entity coverage yet. Focus on technical foundation and internal linking architecture—those move metrics faster for smaller sites.

If you're in a regulated industry (finance, healthcare, legal), add 30 minutes to Layer 1 for compliance-specific crawl issues. HTTPS enforcement, geo-restrictions, gated content handling, consent management platforms—these break indexation in ways Screaming Frog won't flag automatically.

I'll send a few more emails this week with audit salvage tactics and common implementation failures. If you get stuck on prioritization or find something the template doesn't address, reply to this email. I read every response.

## Email 2: Day 2

**Send Timing:** 48 hours after opt-in

**Subject:** The implementation gap nobody talks about

**Preview Text:** Great audit, zero execution. Here's why that happens.

**PASAIDA Element:** Agitation

**Email Body:**

You've probably run this pattern: Paid for an audit. Nodded through the 90-minute presentation. Exported the PDF to Google Drive. Assigned a few tasks in Asana. Checked back 6 months later and realized nothing shipped.

The audit wasn't wrong. The handoff was. Agencies deliver recommendations, collect the invoice, then disappear. Your internal team inherits a 400-page PDF with no prioritization framework, no dependency mapping, no accountability structure. Everything feels equally urgent, which means nothing gets resourced. The deck sits in Slack channels as a reference document while your organic traffic flatlines.

I've reviewed 50+ failed agency audits over the last 3 years. The structural problems repeat:

**No priority matrix.** 200+ recommendations with identical formatting. No distinction between "fix this week" and "consider in Q3 if traffic plateaus." Teams default to easy fixes (meta descriptions, image compression) while high-leverage opportunities (internal linking overhaul, URL architecture consolidation) never get scoped.

**No capacity planning.** Technical fixes assume unlimited developer bandwidth. Content recommendations assume writers can produce 40 articles/month. Link-building strategies assume someone has $15K/month to spend on outreach. The audit ignores your actual resourcing constraints.

**No progress tracking.** Monthly check-ins don't exist. You're left wondering if the first round of fixes moved metrics or if you're three months into a failed strategy. No feedback loop means no course correction.

**No adjustment mechanism.** Search algorithms shift, competitors launch content, technical dependencies change. The audit is a snapshot from 90 days ago, but your team treats it like biblical canon. Nobody's authorized to deviate or re-prioritize.

Here's what execution-focused audits include instead:

The audit isn't the deliverable. The implementation roadmap is. Every recommendation gets sorted into one of three time-bound categories:

**Quick Wins (Month 1):** High impact, low effort, minimal dependencies. These build momentum and prove SEO drives measurable outcomes. Example: Fix 15 broken internal links on your top 20 traffic-driving pages. Takes 2 hours, increases crawl depth for high-authority URLs, shows traffic lift in 4-6 weeks.

**Strategic Projects (Month 2-4):** Medium effort, high impact, requires cross-functional coordination. These move the revenue needle but need PM oversight. Example: Restructure blog taxonomy from chronological archives to topical clusters. Requires content audit (8 hours), URL mapping (4 hours), 301 redirect implementation (dev sprint), internal link updates (12 hours). Traffic impact shows in 8-12 weeks.

**Long-Term Bets (Month 5-12):** High effort, transformational impact, treated as quarterly initiatives not monthly tasks. Example: Build a content hub targeting an underserved keyword cluster with 50+ supporting articles. Requires keyword research (12 hours), content production (6 months), link acquisition strategy (ongoing). Traffic compounds over 12-18 months.

If your audit doesn't include this roadmap with explicit time estimates and dependency chains, you bought analysis theater. Not strategy.

Tomorrow I'll send a case study showing how one company turned a failed $18K audit into a $2M revenue opportunity by extracting 8 recommendations from a list of 200 and ignoring everything else.

**CTA:** None (pure nurture, no ask)

## Email 3: Day 4

**Send Timing:** 96 hours after opt-in

**Subject:** $18K audit → $2M opportunity (by ignoring 96% of it)

**Preview Text:** Real numbers from a real audit rescue.

**PASAIDA Element:** Solution

**Email Body:**

A SaaS company hired me six months after their agency audit landed in the Downloads folder and never got opened again. The audit had 247 recommendations spanning technical SEO, content strategy, link acquisition, conversion optimization, and UX improvements. The team was paralyzed. Everything seemed important. Nothing had an obvious starting point. The CEO forwarded me the PDF and asked which consultant to hire for implementation.

I spent 2 hours reviewing the audit against their **Google Search Console** performance data from the last 12 months. Found the actual constraint: 89% of their organic traffic came from 6% of their pages (34 pages out of 580). Those high-traffic pages had an average internal link count of 3. Their low-traffic pages—the ones they kept producing more of—averaged 12 internal links.

They were linking to content that didn't perform and ignoring content that drove pipeline.

The fix didn't require new content, technical overhauls, or link-building campaigns:

- Ignored 239 of the 247 audit recommendations
- Focused exclusively on 8 recommendations related to internal linking architecture and crawl prioritization
- Built a simple linking rule: High-traffic pages get promoted on homepage, category pages, and navigation elements
- Audited existing blog content for internal link opportunities to top performers
- Implemented in 3 weeks using their existing content inventory—no writing, no dev sprints, no external dependencies

Results after 6 months (tracked in **GSC** and **Google Analytics 4**):

- Organic traffic: +34% (18K → 24K monthly sessions)
- High-traffic page visibility: +67% (measured by impression share for branded + non-branded terms)
- Conversion rate from organic: +18% (high-intent pages received more link equity, ranked for bottom-funnel queries)
- Revenue attributed to organic channel: +$2M annualized (based on their average contract value and close rate)

The agency audit was correct on all 247 recommendations. Technically sound. Thoroughly researched. But correctness doesn't equal priority. The agency had no incentive to prioritize—if they solved the traffic problem in 3 weeks, the client wouldn't sign a 12-month retainer to execute the other 239 tasks.

This is why the 4-Hour Audit Template forces prioritization over comprehensiveness. You don't need to catalogue every technical debt item and content gap. You need to find the constraint that's choking traffic growth and remove it with the least effort possible.

If you've started running audits with the template, reply and tell me what you're finding. I'm building a pattern library across industries and curious what constraints show up most frequently.

## Email 4: Day 7

**Send Timing:** 7 days after opt-in

**Subject:** When fractional SEO consulting is the wrong choice

**Preview Text:** Most companies aren't a fit. Here's the honest breakdown.

**PASAIDA Element:** Authority (Disqualification builds trust)

**Email Body:**

You've been getting emails from me for a week. You might be wondering whether fractional SEO consulting fits your business model. The honest answer: probably not.

Fractional works in a narrow band of conditions. Outside that band, you're better off with an agency, a full-time hire, or solving the problem yourself with templates and frameworks like the one you downloaded.

**You're a fit if:**

**Revenue is $5M-$50M.** Below $5M, you can't justify $8K/month on strategic guidance when execution is the constraint. Above $50M, you need full-time leadership with 40+ hours/week of bandwidth to coordinate cross-functional SEO initiatives. Fractional consulting optimizes for companies that have outgrown DIY execution but haven't scaled into needing a dedicated headcount.

**You have in-house marketing capacity.** Fractional consultants advise and oversee implementation. They don't replace your content team, dev resources, or project management function. If you're asking "Can you just do SEO for us?", you need an agency or a full-time hire, not fractional.

**You've tried agencies and hit the junior execution wall.** You know what bad looks like. You've paid $8K/month for slideware and account management theater. You want senior strategic thinking without paying for a bloated team structure. Fractional gives you 10 hours of senior execution instead of 40 hours of blended junior/senior work.

**You need strategic guidance 10-15 hours/month, not 40.** If your SEO needs are "audit the site, build a roadmap, review our content strategy quarterly, and help us avoid stupid mistakes," fractional works. If your needs are "produce 50 blog posts/month, execute enterprise-scale link building, manage a content team," hire an agency or build in-house.

**You're willing to commit 6+ months.** SEO results take 90-180 days depending on domain authority, competitive intensity, and implementation speed. Monthly consulting won't move metrics. If you need a quick audit and you're done, book a one-time project ($12,500 for audit + roadmap), don't sign a retainer.

**You're NOT a fit if:**

**You want someone to "do SEO for you."** That's an agency or a full-time employee. Fractional consultants tell you what to do and hold you accountable for doing it. They don't write your content, build your links, or execute technical fixes.

**Your team has zero marketing capacity.** If implementation recommendations die in Slack because nobody's available to execute, you'll waste $8K/month on strategy that never ships. Solve the resourcing problem first (hire a marketer, contract with freelancers, scope an agency for execution), then add fractional for strategic oversight.

**You expect results in 30 days.** SEO doesn't work that way regardless of who you hire. If your timeline is "we need leads next month," invest in paid search or cold outbound. SEO is a 6-12 month compound growth channel.

**You're under $3M revenue.** You haven't hit the scale where strategic SEO guidance justifies $96K/year. Solve SEO with founder-led content, an SEO-focused freelancer, or templatized systems first. When you cross $5M and organic traffic becomes a primary growth lever, revisit fractional.

I cap active retainers at 5 clients (50 hours/month total capacity). Right now I have 3 clients, which means 2 spots available. If you're in the "good fit" category and want to explore working together, book a discovery call here: [https://b2bvic.com/calendar](https://b2bvic.com/calendar)

If you're in the "not a fit" category, no hard feelings. Keep the audit template. Use the frameworks. If your business scales into the $5M-$50M band in 12-24 months and you need senior SEO guidance, reach out then.

## Email 5: Day 10

**Send Timing:** 10 days after opt-in

**Subject:** What happens next

**Preview Text:** End of sequence, but not the relationship. Here's what to expect.

**PASAIDA Element:** Action

**Email Body:**

This is the last email in the welcome sequence. You'll stay on my monthly newsletter unless you unsubscribe (link at the bottom—no guilt, no friction).

Once a month I send a deep-dive case study, implementation guide, or framework extraction. Topics I'm working on for Q1:

- How to audit a 10,000-page e-commerce site in 6 hours (4-layer framework applied to product catalogs with faceted navigation and user-generated reviews)
- Real estate SEO at scale: Turning **Follow Up Boss** CRM data into ranking assets (full JAG case study with traffic graphs, lead attribution, and internal linking strategy)
- AI content production without AI voice: Observer Protocol applied to local LLM workflows for enterprises that can't send proprietary data to OpenAI

I don't send product launches, promotional countdowns, or "limited-time offers." If I open a retainer slot, I'll mention it with transparent pricing and qualification criteria. If I release a paid course or workshop, I'll mention it once. Otherwise, pure implementation content.

Three ways to work with me if you need more than monthly emails:

**1. Fractional retainer**

$8K/month for 10 hours of strategic SEO guidance + async Slack access. 6-month minimum commitment. Monthly strategy sessions recorded and delivered in **Notion** with action items and dependency mapping. You get audit oversight, roadmap adjustments, implementation reviews, and quarterly deep-dives.

Currently 2 retainer spots available. I cap at 5 clients total to maintain quality and response time.

**2. One-time project**

Fixed-scope engagements with 3-4 week turnaround:

- Enterprise audit + implementation roadmap: $12,500
- AI content system buildout (local LLM deployment, prompt engineering, quality workflows): $15,000
- Information architecture overhaul (URL restructure, internal linking strategy, topical clustering): $10,000

No ongoing relationship required. You get the deliverable, you own the documentation, you execute internally or with your existing agency.

**3. Strategy call**

30 minutes, free, no pitch deck, no qualification interrogation. Book at [https://b2bvic.com/calendar](https://b2bvic.com/calendar)

I'll review your audit findings, critique your current SEO roadmap, or answer specific questions about information architecture, AI implementation, or technical SEO constraints. If we're a fit for ongoing work, I'll tell you. If not, you still walk away with clearer priorities than any agency discovery call has given you.

If none of those fit your current stage, that's fine. Stay on the list. Keep learning. Keep executing. Reach out when you hit $5M revenue and need senior-level strategic guidance.
