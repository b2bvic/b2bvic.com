# Landing Page Copy: 4-Hour Enterprise SEO Audit Template

---

## HEADLINE

**Most SEO audits waste 40+ hours finding problems you can't prioritize**

---

## SUBHEADLINE

The 4-Hour Enterprise SEO Audit Template isolates revenue-blocking technical issues in a single session

---

## HERO SECTION

### What You Get

A battle-tested audit framework that cuts enterprise SEO analysis from weeks to hours. Built from 300+ audits across SaaS, manufacturing, and B2B service companies with 10,000+ pages.

Delivered as:
- Google Sheets template (copy and customize)
- 47-point checklist organized by impact tier
- Data collection workflows for Screaming Frog, GSC, GA4
- Priority scoring matrix (effort vs. impact)

### Who This Is For

Technical SEO consultants, in-house SEO managers, and agency teams running audits for enterprise clients with complex site architectures.

---

## PROBLEM SECTION

### The Audit Failure Modes

**Scope creep kills timelines.**
You start with technical fundamentals and end up analyzing content strategy, link profiles, and conversion optimization. Three weeks later, you're still building the report.

**No shared language with developers.**
Your recommendations sit in a Notion doc. Engineering doesn't understand priority. Nothing ships.

**False precision wastes time.**
You spend eight hours debugging a canonicalization issue affecting 47 pages. Meanwhile, a server config error is blocking Googlebot from 4,000 product pages.

**Client paralysis from overcomplexity.**
You deliver a 90-page PDF with 200 findings color-coded by severity. The client asks: "What do we do first?" You don't have a clean answer.

The pattern: audits generate data, not decisions.

---

## SOLUTION SECTION

### The 4-Hour Framework

This template operates on one constraint: if you can't complete the audit in a single work session, you're measuring the wrong things.

**Impact tiers, not severity scores.**
Three categories: Crawl Blockers (fix today), Index Inefficiencies (fix this sprint), Optimization Opportunities (roadmap it). No yellow/orange/red ambiguity.

**Data inputs, not detective work.**
Screaming Frog, Google Search Console, server logs. If it requires manual QA, it doesn't scale and won't make the cut.

**Output format: engineering tickets.**
Each finding maps to a Jira/Linear-ready task with acceptance criteria. No translation layer needed.

**Velocity over comprehensiveness.**
You're not documenting every meta description. You're isolating the 12 things preventing the site from performing. Get those fixed, then iterate.

Built for repeat clients. Run this quarterly and track changes over time without reinventing your process.

## WHAT'S INSIDE

### Template Components

**Core Audit Checklist (47 Points)**
- Crawl accessibility verification (robots.txt, server headers, JavaScript rendering)
- Index coverage analysis (canonicalization, noindex patterns, pagination handling)
- Site architecture audit (URL structure, internal linking, faceted navigation)
- Performance baseline (Core Web Vitals, mobile usability, render-blocking resources)

**Data Collection Workflows**
- Screaming Frog export configurations (custom extraction, crawl settings)
- Google Search Console report pulls (coverage issues, performance data, mobile usability)
- GA4 landing page analysis (traffic vs. index coverage reconciliation)
- Server log parsing checklist (Googlebot frequency, response codes, redirect chains)

**Priority Scoring Matrix**
- Effort vs. Impact grid (pre-filled examples from real audits)
- Crawl Blocker identification rules (what qualifies, what doesn't)
- Client communication templates (findings summary, sprint planning format)

**Deliverable Templates**
- Executive summary structure (one-page findings overview)
- Engineering ticket format (pre-written acceptance criteria for common issues)
- Quarterly progress tracker (compare audits over time)

---

## FAQ SECTION

### Common Questions

**Do I need specific tools to use this template?**
Screaming Frog (free version works, paid recommended), Google Search Console access, and Google Analytics 4. If you're running technical audits, you already have these.

**Is this template industry-specific?**
No. It's designed for any site with complex architecture—SaaS platforms, ecommerce catalogs, large corporate sites, multi-location service businesses. The checklist adapts to your client's tech stack.

**How is this different from automated audit tools like Ahrefs or Semrush?**
Those tools generate reports. This template teaches you how to *interpret* data and communicate findings to non-SEO stakeholders. It's a process framework, not a data source.

**Can I customize the template for my agency's workflow?**
Yes. It's a Google Sheet. Add your branding, modify the checklist, adjust priority tiers. The structure is a starting point, not a prescription.

**What if I'm new to enterprise SEO audits?**
This assumes you understand technical SEO fundamentals (crawling, indexing, site architecture). If you're still learning those concepts, start there first. This template won't teach you technical SEO—it organizes what you already know into a repeatable client delivery system.
