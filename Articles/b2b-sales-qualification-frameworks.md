# B2B Sales Qualification Frameworks: BANT, MEDDIC, and When to Use Which

Sales reps waste time on unqualified prospects because they can't distinguish between polite interest and buying intent. A prospect who says "this looks interesting, send me some information" isn't qualified — they're being polite. A prospect who says "we're implementing Q2, budget approved, I'm the decision-maker" is qualified. Qualification frameworks provide systematic criteria for separating real opportunities from time wasters.

The problem: most companies use BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) by default without questioning whether it fits their sales cycle. BANT works for transactional sales but fails for complex enterprise deals requiring multiple stakeholders. **MEDDIC** (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion) works for enterprise but overcomplicate for SMB. This article explains 5 qualification frameworks, when to use each, and how to implement them in [CRM systems](/articles/crm-optimization-b2b-sales.html) for consistent execution.

## Framework 1: BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline)

**Best for:** Transactional B2B sales ($5K-$50K deals), short sales cycles (30-60 days), single decision-maker

**Origin:** IBM, 1960s

### The Four Criteria

**Budget:** Does the prospect have money allocated for this purchase?
**Authority:** Are you speaking with the person who can sign the contract?
**Need:** Does the prospect have a problem your solution solves?
**Timeline:** When are they looking to implement?

### Discovery Questions

**Budget:**
- "Have you allocated budget for this project?"
- "What range are you working within?"
- "If the solution delivers [desired outcome], can you secure budget within [timeframe]?"

**Authority:**
- "Who else is involved in this decision?"
- "What's your role in the purchasing process?"
- "Do you have approval authority, or does this need to go up the chain?"

**Need:**
- "What's driving you to look for a solution now?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this problem?"
- "What have you tried so far?"

**Timeline:**
- "When do you need this implemented?"
- "What's driving that timeline?"
- "Are there any events or deadlines creating urgency?"

### Qualification Scorecard

Assign 1-5 points per criterion:

| Criterion | 5 points | 3 points | 1 point |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------|
| Budget | Approved and allocated | Available but needs approval | No budget, must build business case |
| Authority | Speaking with final decision-maker | Influencer with access to decision-maker | Low-level contact, no access |
| Need | Urgent problem, high impact | Moderate problem, nice-to-have | Vague interest, no clear pain |
| Timeline | Implementing within 30 days | 30-90 days | No timeline |

**Minimum qualification score:** 12/20 (3 average per criterion)

### When BANT Fails

**Scenario 1: Complex buying committees**
BANT assumes single decision-maker. Enterprise deals involve 5-10 stakeholders (IT, procurement, finance, operations). "Authority" becomes meaningless.

**Scenario 2: Long sales cycles**
BANT's "Timeline" criterion assumes prospects know when they'll buy. In 6-12 month sales cycles, timelines shift constantly.

**Scenario 3: Strategic partnerships**
BANT optimizes for transactional efficiency. Strategic deals require relationship building, not rapid qualification.

**When to use BANT:** SMB deals, SaaS subscriptions under $50K annually, short sales cycles.

## Framework 2: MEDDIC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion)

**Best for:** Enterprise B2B sales ($100K+ deals), complex buying committees, 6-12 month sales cycles

**Origin:** PTC (Parametric Technology Corporation), 1990s

### The Six Criteria

**Metrics:** What quantifiable business outcomes does the prospect need?
**Economic Buyer:** Who controls the budget and has final approval authority?
**Decision Criteria:** What factors will the prospect use to evaluate solutions?
**Decision Process:** What steps must happen before a contract is signed?
**Identify Pain:** What specific problem is costing them money, time, or opportunity?
**Champion:** Who inside the organization is advocating for your solution?

### Discovery Questions

**Metrics:**
- "What does success look like in measurable terms?"
- "If we could reduce [cost/time/errors] by X%, would that justify the investment?"
- "How are you currently measuring this problem?"

**Economic Buyer:**
- "Who ultimately signs off on investments of this size?"
- "Have you worked with [Economic Buyer] on similar projects?"
- "What's [Economic Buyer's] top priority this year?"

**Decision Criteria:**
- "What factors are most important in choosing a vendor?"
- "How will you compare our solution to alternatives?"
- "Are there any non-negotiable requirements?"

**Decision Process:**
- "Walk me through your typical procurement process."
- "Who needs to approve before a contract is signed?"
- "Are there any legal, security, or compliance reviews required?"

**Identify Pain:**
- "What's this problem costing you per month/quarter/year?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 6 months?"
- "What's the political cost of this problem? (Who's getting blamed?)"

**Champion:**
- "Who internally would benefit most from solving this?"
- "If I weren't in this meeting, who would push this project forward?"
- "Can you introduce me to [stakeholder] who owns this pain point?"

### MEDDIC Qualification Checklist

| Criterion | Qualified | Not Qualified |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Metrics | Clear, measurable ROI identified | Vague goals, no numbers |
| Economic Buyer | Identified and engaged | Unknown or inaccessible |
| Decision Criteria | Understood and we meet them | Unclear or we don't meet them |
| Decision Process | Mapped with timeline | Unknown or constantly changing |
| Identify Pain | Urgent, expensive problem | Nice-to-have, low urgency |
| Champion | Active internal advocate | No champion or passive support |

**Minimum to proceed:** 4/6 criteria must be "Qualified"

### When MEDDIC Fails

**Scenario 1: SMB deals**
MEDDIC is overkill for $10K SaaS subscriptions. SMBs don't have complex decision processes or political champions.

**Scenario 2: Founder-led companies**
Startups with founder decision-makers don't need multi-stakeholder mapping. The founder is Economic Buyer, Champion, and Decision Process.

**When to use MEDDIC:** Enterprise sales, deals >$100K, multi-stakeholder environments.

## Framework 3: CHAMP (Challenges, Authority, Money, Prioritization)

**Best for:** Consultative B2B sales, solution selling, when relationship matters more than speed

**Origin:** InsightSquared, 2010s

### The Four Criteria

**Challenges:** What problems keep the prospect up at night?
**Authority:** Who can make this decision happen?
**Money:** Can they afford the solution?
**Prioritization:** Is solving this problem a priority *right now*?

### Why CHAMP > BANT for Consultative Sales

**BANT starts with Budget.** Asking about money first creates transactional dynamic.

**CHAMP starts with Challenges.** Understanding problems first builds trust and positions you as advisor, not vendor.

**BANT assumes budget exists.** Many prospects don't have budget allocated but can secure it for the right solution.

**CHAMP assumes budget can be created.** If the challenge is urgent enough, money appears.

### Discovery Questions

**Challenges:**
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing with [area]?"
- "How is this challenge impacting your team/revenue/customers?"
- "What have you tried already?"

**Authority:**
- "Who else is affected by this challenge?"
- "If we solve this, who gets the credit?"
- "Who needs to sign off?"

**Money:**
- "If we can solve [challenge] and deliver [outcome], what would that be worth?"
- "Have you solved similar problems before? What did you invest?"

**Prioritization:**
- "Where does this rank among your top 3 priorities this quarter?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this in the next 90 days?"
- "Are there other projects competing for resources?"

### When to use CHAMP

- Consultative sales (professional services, fractional roles, advisory)
- Relationship-based sales (long-term partnerships, not transactions)
- When educating the market (new category, prospects don't know they have a problem)

## Framework 4: GPCT (Goals, Plans, Challenges, Timeline)

**Best for:** Inbound leads, content-driven sales, when prospects are already educated

**Origin:** HubSpot, 2010s

### The Four Criteria

**Goals:** What is the prospect trying to achieve?
**Plans:** What's their current plan to achieve it?
**Challenges:** What's preventing them from executing the plan?
**Timeline:** When do they need to achieve the goal?

### Discovery Questions

**Goals:**
- "What are you trying to accomplish this year?"
- "What does success look like?"
- "How will hitting this goal impact the business?"

**Plans:**
- "What's your current approach?"
- "What resources are you dedicating to this?"
- "What's working and what's not?"

**Challenges:**
- "What's stopping you from executing the plan?"
- "Where are the gaps?"
- "What would need to change for the plan to succeed?"

**Timeline:**
- "When do you need to hit this goal?"
- "What happens if you miss the deadline?"
- "Are there external pressures (board, investors, competitors) driving timing?"

### When GPCT Works Best

**Inbound leads** who downloaded content, attended webinar, or requested demo are already educated. They have goals and plans. Your job: identify gaps in their plan and position your solution as the missing piece.

**GPCT assumes prospect is proactive.** They're already trying to solve the problem. You're not creating urgency — you're capitalizing on existing urgency.

## Framework 5: ANUM (Authority, Need, Urgency, Money)

**Best for:** Cold outreach, outbound sales, when you need to disqualify fast

**Origin:** Sales training community, 2000s

### The Four Criteria (Reordered for Efficiency)

**Authority:** Are you talking to the decision-maker?
**Need:** Do they have a problem you solve?
**Urgency:** Do they need to solve it now?
**Money:** Can they afford your solution?

### Why ANUM Reorders BANT

**ANUM puts Authority first.** If you're talking to someone who can't buy, nothing else matters. Disqualify immediately.

**ANUM puts Money last.** If they have authority, need, and urgency, money can be figured out. Don't disqualify prematurely based on budget.

### When to use ANUM

- Outbound sales (cold calling, cold email)
- High-volume sales (qualify fast, move on)
- When time is your constraint (can't afford long discovery calls with tire-kickers)

## Choosing the Right Framework

| Framework | Deal Size | Sales Cycle | Buying Committee | Best For |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| BANT | $5K-$50K | 30-60 days | Single decision-maker | Transactional SMB |
| MEDDIC | $100K+ | 6-12 months | 5-10 stakeholders | Enterprise |
| CHAMP | $25K-$150K | 60-120 days | 2-4 stakeholders | Consultative |
| GPCT | $10K-$100K | 30-90 days | 1-3 stakeholders | Inbound, educated prospects |
| ANUM | $5K-$50K | 30-60 days | Single decision-maker | Outbound, high-volume |

## Implementing Qualification in CRM

Qualification frameworks fail if they live in training documents instead of daily workflows. Implementation requires CRM fields, scorecards, and automation.

### CRM Custom Fields (BANT Example)

**Budget:**
- Budget allocated? (Yes/No/Unknown)
- Budget range: ($0-$10K / $10K-$25K / $25K-$50K / $50K+)

**Authority:**
- Decision-maker identified? (Yes/No)
- Decision-maker engaged? (Yes/No)
- Role: (C-level / VP / Director / Manager / Individual contributor)

**Need:**
- Pain level: (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Impact if unsolved: (Text field)

**Timeline:**
- Target implementation date: (Date field)
- Timeline confidence: (Confirmed / Likely / Uncertain)

### Automated Qualification Scoring

Assign point values to each criterion. CRM calculates score automatically.

**Example BANT scoring:**
- Budget allocated = 5 points
- Budget available but needs approval = 3 points
- No budget = 0 points
- Decision-maker engaged = 5 points
- Influencer with access = 3 points
- Low-level contact = 1 point
- Critical pain = 5 points
- High pain = 4 points
- Medium pain = 2 points
- Low pain = 1 point
- Timeline <30 days = 5 points
- Timeline 30-90 days = 3 points
- No timeline = 0 points

**Qualification threshold:** 12+ points = Qualified, <12 points = Disqualified

### Qualification Alerts

**Alert 1:** Lead enters CRM → Notify rep to complete qualification within 48 hours
**Alert 2:** Lead marked Qualified with score <12 → Alert sales manager for review
**Alert 3:** Qualified lead stalls for 14 days → Trigger re-qualification (has anything changed?)

## Common Mistakes in Qualification

### Mistake 1: Qualifying Too Early

Asking budget questions in first 5 minutes of first conversation creates transactional dynamic and triggers prospect defensiveness. Solution: Build rapport, understand challenges, demonstrate value *before* qualifying on budget.

### Mistake 2: Accepting Vague Answers

Prospect: "We're definitely interested."
Rep: (marks as Qualified)

"Interested" isn't qualified. Qualified requires specifics: timeline, budget, decision process.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Red Flags

Prospect misses 3 scheduled calls, doesn't respond to emails for 2 weeks, but rep keeps them in pipeline as "Qualified" because they once expressed interest. Solution: Re-qualify regularly. Interest fades. Disqualify decisively.

### Mistake 4: One-Size-Fits-All

Using BANT for enterprise deals or MEDDIC for $5K SMB sales. Match framework to sales context.

## FAQ

### Can I combine multiple frameworks?

Yes. Many companies use hybrid models (e.g., BANT + Champion from MEDDIC). Tailor to your sales process.

### How often should I re-qualify?

Every 30 days for long sales cycles. Budgets change, timelines shift, stakeholders leave. What was qualified in Q1 might be disqualified in Q2.

### What if prospect refuses to answer qualification questions?

Either they're not serious (disqualify) or you haven't built enough trust (focus on value delivery, try again later). Don't proceed without qualification — you'll waste months on dead deals.

### Should I disqualify if they fail one criterion?

Depends. Failing "Authority" (talking to intern with no access) = immediate disqualify. Failing "Timeline" (no urgency) = nurture for later. Use judgment.

### How do I train reps to qualify consistently?

Role play discovery calls, review CRM data for qualification accuracy, tie qualification scores to forecast accuracy (hold reps accountable for inflated pipelines).
