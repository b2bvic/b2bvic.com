# AI Content Editing Checklist: 23 Patterns That Reveal Machine-Generated Text

AI content editing separates publishable from detectable. An unedited **Claude** or **GPT-4** draft carries dozens of machine fingerprints — lexical patterns, structural tells, and tonal markers that trained readers (and detection algorithms) recognize instantly. The difference between content that reads as AI slop and content that passes as human-written isn't the base model. It's the editing checklist applied before publication.

This checklist catalogs the 23 most common AI content patterns I've identified across 500+ articles produced through [AI workflows](/articles/ai-content-production-workflow.html). Each pattern includes the detection marker, why it matters, and the editing fix. Use this as a quality gate before publishing any AI-assisted content where detection risk matters.

The checklist is organized into five categories: lexical patterns, structural patterns, tonal patterns, logical patterns, and meta patterns. Run every AI draft through all 23 checks. The articles that pass publish. The articles that fail get re-edited or regenerated.

## Lexical Patterns (Word Choice Tells)

### 1. Overuse of "Leverage"

**The tell:** AI models love "leverage" as a verb. "Leverage AI tools," "leverage data," "leverage automation." Human writers use "leverage" sparingly. Its overuse signals machine generation.

**Why it matters:** "Leverage" is corporate jargon. Overuse makes content sound like a consulting slide deck, not human communication.

**The fix:** Replace with precise verbs. "Leverage AI tools" → "use AI tools," "deploy AI systems," "exploit AI capabilities." Ban "leverage" entirely from your AI outputs.

### 2. "Utilize" Instead of "Use"

**The tell:** AI defaults to "utilize" when "use" is simpler and more natural. "Utilize this framework" vs. "use this framework."

**Why it matters:** Humans prefer simple words. "Utilize" adds syllables without adding meaning. It's a formality marker that AI overuses.

**The fix:** Global find-replace. Replace all instances of "utilize" with "use" unless the context genuinely requires the distinction (it rarely does).

### 3. "Robust," "Comprehensive," "Effective"

**The tell:** These adjectives appear in 60%+ of unedited AI content. "A robust solution," "a comprehensive approach," "an effective strategy."

**Why it matters:** They're vague intensifiers that carry no information. Human writers use specific descriptors.

**The fix:** Replace with specific attributes. "A robust solution" → "a solution that handled 10,000 requests/second without timeouts." "A comprehensive approach" → "an approach covering technical SEO, content, and link building."

### 4. "However," "Moreover," "Furthermore"

**The tell:** AI overuses formal transition words. Consecutive paragraphs often start with "However," "Moreover," "Additionally," "Furthermore."

**Why it matters:** These transitions create academic tone. Conversational writing uses shorter, punchier transitions or none at all.

**The fix:** Replace with simpler transitions. "However" → "But." "Moreover" → "Also" or delete entirely. "Furthermore" → Start a new sentence without a transition.

### 5. "It's Worth Noting That"

**The tell:** AI uses this phrase to hedge or introduce caveats. "It's worth noting that results may vary."

**Why it matters:** It's verbal padding. Humans state the caveat directly without the preamble.

**The fix:** Delete the phrase. "It's worth noting that results may vary" → "Results vary based on industry and implementation quality."

## Structural Patterns (Organization Tells)

### 6. Bullet-Point-Then-Explanation Rhythm

**The tell:** Every heading is followed by a bulleted list, and every bullet is followed by a paragraph of explanation. The rhythm becomes monotonous.

**Why it matters:** Predictable structure signals algorithmic organization. Humans vary structure more.

**The fix:** Break the pattern. Follow some headings with narrative paragraphs. Follow others with tables, examples, or case studies. Some bullets get one sentence. Others get three paragraphs.

### 7. Perfectly Balanced H2 Sections

**The tell:** Every H2 section has roughly equal word count (400-600 words per section). AI optimizes for structural symmetry.

**Why it matters:** Human-written articles have uneven sections. Important topics get 1,200 words. Minor points get 200 words.

**The fix:** Expand critical sections and compress less important ones. Aim for 30-50% variation in section length.

### 8. FAQ Sections with Generic Questions

**The tell:** FAQ sections with obvious questions ("What is [topic]?" "Why is [topic] important?" "How do I get started with [topic]?") that could apply to any article on the subject.

**Why it matters:** Generic FAQs add no value and signal that the content wasn't tailored to reader needs.

**The fix:** Replace with specific questions from **People Also Ask**, user comments, or sales calls. "What's the difference between [specific tool A] and [specific tool B]?" is better than "What tools should I use?"

### 9. Nested Bullet Points With No Variation

**The tell:** Every list uses the same bullet format. No mixing of numbered lists, checkboxes, or narrative alternatives.

**Why it matters:** Human writers vary list formats for emphasis and function. AI defaults to bullets for everything.

**The fix:** Use numbered lists for sequential steps. Use checkboxes for action items. Use narrative paragraphs when the content doesn't fit list structure.

### 10. Uniform Sentence Length

**The tell:** Sentences cluster around 15-20 words. No short punchy sentences (5 words). No long complex sentences (35+ words).

**Why it matters:** Sentence rhythm variation is a human writing marker. AI outputs toward statistical average length.

**The fix:** Deliberately vary sentence length. Aim for a range of 5-35 words. Follow a long sentence with a short one. "This is critical."

## Tonal Patterns (Voice Tells)

### 11. No Strong Opinions

**The tell:** Content presents multiple perspectives without taking a position. "Some experts believe X, while others suggest Y."

**Why it matters:** Human subject-matter experts have opinions. They argue for specific approaches, not neutral summaries.

**The fix:** Insert author perspective. "The 'best practice' crowd recommends X. I've tested both X and Y on 30 sites. Y works better for B2B SaaS. Here's why."

### 12. Excessive Hedging

**The tell:** Every claim is qualified. "This approach may help improve results in certain contexts." "Strategies can often lead to better outcomes."

**Why it matters:** Hedging signals uncertainty or legal caution. Experts make bolder, more specific claims.

**The fix:** Remove qualifiers. "This approach improves conversion rates by 15-30% for B2B SaaS landing pages with $10K+ ACV. It doesn't work for e-commerce." Specificity replaces hedging.

### 13. Overly Formal Tone

**The tell:** Content reads like a white paper, not a conversation. "Organizations should implement comprehensive strategies to optimize outcomes."

**Why it matters:** B2B operators read content to solve problems, not to be impressed by formality.

**The fix:** Write like you're explaining the concept to a colleague over coffee. Replace "Organizations should implement" with "If you're running a B2B sales team, build this system."

### 14. No Contractions

**The tell:** AI defaults to "do not," "it is," "you are" instead of "don't," "it's," "you're."

**Why it matters:** Conversational writing uses contractions. Academic writing avoids them. Most B2B content should lean conversational.

**The fix:** Replace formal phrases with contractions unless you're deliberately writing in formal register for a specific audience.

### 15. Sycophantic Openings

**The tell:** Articles start with validation. "That's a great question!" "You're right to be concerned about X." "It's completely understandable that you'd want to know about Y."

**Why it matters:** AI models are trained to be helpful and agreeable. Human writers get to the point.

**The fix:** Delete the validation and start with substance. "You're right to be concerned about AI detection" → "AI detection tools flag 70% of unedited GPT-4 content. Here's how to evade them."

## Logical Patterns (Reasoning Tells)

### 16. Missing Causal Connections

**The tell:** AI states facts in sequence without explaining why one follows from another. "Step 1: Do X. Step 2: Do Y. Step 3: Do Z."

**Why it matters:** Human writers explain the logic. "Do X because it enables Y, which is required for Z to work."

**The fix:** Add causal reasoning. Connect steps with "This enables...," "The reason this works is...," "Without this, the next step fails because..."

### 17. Examples That Lack Specificity

**The tell:** Vague examples. "A company I worked with increased revenue by implementing these strategies."

**Why it matters:** Vague examples could be hallucinated. Specific examples carry credibility markers (numbers, names, timeframes).

**The fix:** Add specifics. "A SaaS client generating $400K/month increased organic revenue to $680K/month over 6 months by building 80 cluster articles around their core product keywords."

### 18. No Trade-Offs Acknowledged

**The tell:** Content presents strategies as universally beneficial without acknowledging costs, risks, or contexts where they fail.

**Why it matters:** Everything has trade-offs. Experts know this. AI defaults to positivity.

**The fix:** Explicitly state trade-offs. "This approach works for B2B SaaS but fails for local service businesses because..."

### 19. Circular Definitions

**The tell:** Definitions that restate the term being defined. "Content marketing is the practice of using content for marketing purposes."

**Why it matters:** Circular definitions carry zero information. They're filler that AI generates when it doesn't have real knowledge.

**The fix:** Replace with operational definitions. "Content marketing means publishing educational articles that rank for commercial keywords and convert readers into leads."

### 20. Missing Failure Modes

**The tell:** Content explains how to succeed but never addresses how things fail or what mistakes to avoid.

**Why it matters:** Human experts have seen failures. They warn about pitfalls. AI focuses on success paths.

**The fix:** Add "Common Mistakes" or "What Not to Do" sections. Describe failure modes with specifics.

## Meta Patterns (Content-About-Content Tells)

### 21. Summarizing the Summary

**The tell:** Content restates points already made. "In this article, we discussed X, Y, and Z. These strategies will help you achieve better results."

**Why it matters:** Summaries of summaries add no information. They're padding.

**The fix:** Delete recap sections unless the article is 5,000+ words and genuinely needs synthesis. End with next actions or a provocative question instead.

### 22. "In This Article" Announcements

**The tell:** Explicit roadmaps. "In this article, we'll explore five strategies for..." or "Below, you'll find a comprehensive guide to..."

**Why it matters:** Readers can see the headings. They don't need verbal roadmaps unless the structure is complex.

**The fix:** Delete meta-commentary about structure. Jump directly into substance.

### 23. Stock Conclusions

**The tell:** Conclusions that could end any article on the topic. "By implementing these strategies, you'll be well on your way to achieving your goals."

**Why it matters:** Generic conclusions don't synthesize insights or provide next actions. They're filler.

**The fix:** End with specifics. "Start by auditing your top 20 pages with [tool]. Fix the H1 duplication issues first — they're causing 60% of your ranking fragility. The internal linking fixes can wait until month two."

## How to Use This Checklist

### For Every AI Draft Before Publishing:

1. **Pass 1 (Lexical):** Search for tells 1-5. Find-replace or rewrite flagged instances.
2. **Pass 2 (Structural):** Review section balance, list formats, sentence rhythm. Vary where monotonous.
3. **Pass 3 (Tonal):** Check for hedging, formality, sycophancy. Inject opinion and directness.
4. **Pass 4 (Logical):** Verify causal connections, example specificity, trade-off acknowledgment.
5. **Pass 5 (Meta):** Delete summaries-of-summaries, structural announcements, stock conclusions.

Time investment: 10-15 minutes per 2,500-word article.

### For Training AI to Avoid Patterns:

Include anti-pattern instructions in your system prompts:

> "Do not use the words 'leverage,' 'utilize,' 'robust,' 'comprehensive,' or 'moreover.' Vary sentence length from 5 to 35 words. Do not start with sycophantic validation. State opinions backed by specific examples. Include trade-offs and failure modes. End with specific next actions, not generic conclusions."

AI won't perfectly follow these constraints, but it reduces the frequency of flagged patterns.

## Detection Risk Scoring

Assign a detection risk score based on how many patterns remain after editing:

- **0-3 patterns:** Low risk (<20% AI probability on detection tools)
- **4-8 patterns:** Medium risk (20-40% AI probability)
- **9-15 patterns:** High risk (40-60% AI probability)
- **16+ patterns:** Very high risk (60%+ AI probability — do not publish without heavy re-editing)

Track scores across your content inventory. If average scores are above 8, tighten your editing process or improve your base prompts.

## Prompt Engineering to Reduce Editing Load

The best editing is prevention. Engineer prompts to avoid patterns before generation:

**Example anti-pattern prompt:**
> "Write a 2,500-word article on [topic] for B2B operators. Requirements:
> - No words: leverage, utilize, robust, comprehensive, moreover, furthermore
> - Vary sentence length: 5-35 words, mix short and long
> - Include 2 specific examples with numbers and outcomes
> - State clear opinions, avoid hedging (no 'may,' 'can,' 'often')
> - End with specific next actions, not summary
> - Acknowledge trade-offs and failure modes
> - Write in first-person operator voice, not third-person formal"

This prompt pre-empts 12+ checklist items, reducing post-generation editing time.

## FAQ

### Can I automate this checklist with another AI pass?

Partially. You can prompt **Claude** or **GPT-4** to "review this draft against the 23-pattern checklist and flag violations." The AI will catch some patterns (especially lexical tells) but miss others (nuanced voice issues). Human review remains necessary for high-stakes content.

### How many of these patterns trigger detection tools?

Detection tools use perplexity, burstiness, and embedding analysis — they don't explicitly check for "leverage" or "moreover." But these patterns *correlate* with low perplexity and uniform structure that detectors flag. Fixing the patterns improves detection scores indirectly.

### Should I apply this checklist to internal documentation?

Only if detection matters for your use case. Internal SOPs, process docs, and technical guides don't need to evade detection. Apply the checklist only to client-facing, published, or audience-sensitive content.

### How often should I update this checklist?

Monthly. AI models evolve. New patterns emerge. Track which patterns appear most frequently in your content and add them to the checklist. Retire patterns that models no longer generate.

### What if applying the checklist makes my content worse?

You're over-applying fixes. The goal isn't to eliminate all structure or formality — it's to eliminate *monotonous* structure and *unnecessary* formality. Preserve clarity. Remove only the patterns that add no value.
