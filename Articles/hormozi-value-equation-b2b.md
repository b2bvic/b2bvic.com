# The Hormozi Value Equation for B2B Services: Price on Value, Not Hours

**Alex Hormozi's Value Equation** exposes why B2B services compete on price when they should compete on value. Most consultants price at $150/hour and wonder why prospects ghost after proposals. Meanwhile, operators who master the equation charge $10K-$50K for identical deliverables because they engineer perceived value, not just deliver outputs.

The equation:

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

This isn't theory—it's the pricing architecture behind every high-ticket B2B service that closes without objection. Fractional SEO consultants earning $200K/year use it. Marketing agencies charging $25K/month retainers use it. Solo operators replacing $300K agency contracts use it.

This guide dissects how B2B service providers operationalize each variable to increase perceived value by 3-5x without changing deliverables.

## Why Traditional B2B Pricing Fails

Most B2B services price using cost-plus logic:

```
Price = (Hours × Hourly Rate) + Margin
```

This creates commoditization. Clients compare your $150/hour to competitors' $120/hour and choose cheaper.

The Value Equation inverts this:

```
Price = Perceived Value to Client
```

If a client perceives your service delivers $500K in outcome and they're 80% confident you'll achieve it, they'll pay $100K without hesitation. The math isn't hours—it's return on investment.

## Variable 1: Dream Outcome (What They Get)

**Dream Outcome** is the result the client obsesses over. Not features, not deliverables—**the transformed state after your engagement**.

### Bad Positioning (Feature-Focused)

"I'll audit your SEO, build 50 backlinks, and optimize 20 pages."

**Client thinks:** "What does this actually do for my business?"

### Good Positioning (Outcome-Focused)

"I'll increase your organic lead flow from 40 to 120 qualified leads/month within 6 months, reducing your CAC by $150/lead."

**Client thinks:** "That's $12K/month in savings, worth $72K annually."

### How to Discover Dream Outcomes

Interview 5-10 past clients. Ask:

1. "What problem were you trying to solve when you hired me?"
2. "How did you measure success?"
3. "What would have happened if you didn't solve this problem?"

Their answers reveal the dream outcome. It's rarely "better SEO"—it's "hit $2M ARR so we can raise Series A."

### Quantifying Dream Outcomes

B2B buyers need numbers. Convert outcomes to:

- **Revenue impact** ("Generate $500K in pipeline")
- **Cost reduction** ("Cut CAC from $300 to $180")
- **Time savings** ("Reduce contract cycle from 90 to 45 days")
- **Risk mitigation** ("Avoid $200K penalty for compliance failure")

Example: SEO consultant positioning

**Before:** "I'll improve your organic traffic."
**After:** "I'll generate 80 qualified leads/month from organic search, worth $240K in annual pipeline at your current close rate."

## Variable 2: Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Believability)

Clients discount value based on skepticism. If they're 50% confident you'll deliver, they mentally cut your proposal value in half.

**Perceived Likelihood** is trust-building architecture.

### Proof Mechanisms

**1. Case Studies with Specificity**

Bad case study: "We helped a SaaS company grow organic traffic."

Good case study: "We helped Acme SaaS (50-person team, $5M ARR) increase organic traffic from 2,000 to 8,000 monthly sessions in 9 months, generating 60 new SQLs worth $180K in pipeline. Here's their CEO on video explaining the results."

**Specificity = credibility.** Vague results signal fabrication.

**2. Process Transparency**

Document your methodology in public. Example:

"I use a 4-phase SEO audit framework:
1. Technical crawl (3 days)
2. Content gap analysis (2 days)
3. Backlink competitive assessment (2 days)
4. Implementation roadmap (1 day)

Here's the Notion template I use: [link]"

**Transparency disarms skepticism.** Clients see you're not winging it.

**3. Guarantees and Risk Reversal**

Standard B2B service: "Pay $10K, we'll do our best."

Risk-reversed offer: "Pay $10K. If we don't generate 40 qualified leads in 90 days, we'll work for free until we do."

**Guarantees shift risk from client to provider.** Only offer if you're confident in outcomes.

**4. Social Proof Stacking**

Layer multiple proof types:

- Testimonials (video > text)
- Client logos (recognizable brands)
- Results screenshots (Google Analytics, CRM data)
- Industry recognition (speaking engagements, publications)

One fractional consultant lists: "Spoken at SaaStr, published in TechCrunch, advised 40+ B2B SaaS companies." This compounds credibility.

### Common Believability Killers

**Red Flag 1: No portfolio or past results**

If you're new, partner with a client on performance basis (free upfront, percentage of results). Document that win, use it to close next client at full price.

**Red Flag 2: Generic testimonials**

"Great to work with!" adds zero believability. Request specific testimonials: "What problem did I solve? What was the measurable outcome?"

**Red Flag 3: Overpromising**

"I'll 10x your traffic in 30 days" triggers skepticism. Realistic promises with proof convert better than wild claims.

## Variable 3: Time Delay (How Long Until They Get It)

**Time Delay** kills value. A result in 12 months is worth less than the same result in 3 months.

### Accelerating Perceived Speed

**Tactic 1: Phase Deliverables**

Instead of "SEO results in 6 months," structure as:

- **Month 1:** Technical audit complete, quick wins implemented (expect 10-15% traffic lift)
- **Month 2:** Content strategy launched, first 5 articles published
- **Month 3:** Backlink campaign started, 20 links secured
- **Months 4-6:** Compounding results, targeting 100% traffic increase

Clients see progress monthly, not after 6 months.

**Tactic 2: Early Wins Strategy**

Identify 3-5 "quick win" tactics that deliver results in 30 days. Lead with these.

Example: Before optimizing for long-tail keywords (slow), fix technical SEO errors that tank rankings (fast lift).

**Tactic 3: Transparent Timelines**

Gantt chart or roadmap shows work in progress. Clients see you're executing, not stalling.

**Tactic 4: Financing Structures**

For high-ticket services, offer payment plans aligned with milestone delivery:

- 30% upfront
- 30% at midpoint (Month 3)
- 40% upon completion (Month 6)

This psychologically shortens time delay—they're paying as results materialize.

### Why "We'll Get You Results Eventually" Fails

Clients mentally discount distant outcomes. $100K in 12 months feels riskier than $50K in 3 months, even though the first is 2x larger.

Solution: Break projects into phases. Sell Phase 1, deliver results, upsell Phase 2.

## Variable 4: Effort & Sacrifice (What They Must Do)

**Effort & Sacrifice** is friction. The more work clients must do, the less they value your service.

### Common B2B Friction Points

1. **Client must provide data/access** (CRM exports, analytics logins)
2. **Client must attend weekly meetings** (time commitment)
3. **Client must implement recommendations** (internal coordination)
4. **Client must manage contractors** (oversight burden)

Each friction point reduces perceived value.

### Friction Reduction Strategies

**Done-For-You vs. Done-With-You vs. DIY**

| Model | Effort | Value | Price |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| **DIY Course** | High (client does everything) | Low | $500-$2K |
| **Done-With-You** | Medium (you guide, they execute) | Medium | $5K-$15K |
| **Done-For-You** | Low (you handle everything) | High | $15K-$50K+ |

**Done-For-You commands 3-10x pricing** because client effort approaches zero.

**Tactic 1: Own the Implementation**

Instead of: "Here's your SEO audit. Now you implement these 40 recommendations."

Offer: "Here's your SEO audit. My team will implement all 40 recommendations this month."

Second version is 5x more valuable to time-constrained executives.

**Tactic 2: Reduce Meeting Overhead**

Instead of: "Weekly 1-hour strategy calls."

Offer: "Async updates via Loom every Friday. We'll meet only when you have questions or need strategic input."

Respect for client time increases perceived value.

**Tactic 3: Streamline Onboarding**

Bad onboarding: "Fill out this 50-question intake form, then schedule three discovery calls."

Good onboarding: "I'll record a 15-minute Loom walking through your current setup. Reply with your top 3 goals. We'll start Monday."

Friction at onboarding predicts friction throughout engagement. Minimize it.

**Tactic 4: Deliver Templates and Systems**

Don't just provide advice—give clients copy-paste systems.

Example: Instead of "You should implement lead scoring," deliver:

- Google Sheets lead scoring calculator (pre-built)
- Scoring criteria documented
- Integration instructions for their CRM

**Plug-and-play deliverables reduce effort to near-zero.**

## Applying the Value Equation to Pricing

Let's price an SEO consulting engagement using the equation.

### Scenario: Fractional SEO for B2B SaaS

**Client Context:**
- 30-person team
- $3M ARR
- CAC = $500 (paid ads)
- Goal: Reduce CAC via organic lead gen

**Step 1: Define Dream Outcome**

"Generate 60 qualified leads/month from organic search within 6 months, reducing CAC to $200."

**Outcome value:**
- 60 leads/month × $200 CAC savings = $12K/month
- Annual value = $144K

**Step 2: Establish Likelihood**

Provide proof:
- 3 case studies (similar company size, 50-80 lead/month outcomes)
- Video testimonials
- 90-day performance guarantee

**Client perceives 70-80% likelihood.**

**Step 3: Minimize Time Delay**

Phased approach:
- Month 1-2: Technical fixes + quick wins (10-15 leads)
- Month 3-4: Content production ramps (30 leads)
- Month 5-6: Full velocity (60 leads)

**Clients see results by Month 2, not Month 6.**

**Step 4: Eliminate Effort**

Done-for-you model:
- We write, publish, and optimize all content
- We build backlinks
- We provide dashboard (no meetings unless needed)

**Client effort: 2 hours/month for strategy alignment.**

### Pricing Calculation

**Perceived value:** $144K/year (CAC savings)
**Likelihood discount:** 75% confidence = $108K perceived value
**Fair price:** 20-30% of annual value = $21K-$32K

**Offer:** $25K for 6-month engagement ($4,166/month retainer)

**Client math:**
- Pays $25K
- Saves $144K annually (ROI = 476%)
- Minimal effort required

This closes at 60-70% because the value is obvious.

### Contrast with Hourly Pricing

If you priced at $150/hour and estimated 100 hours:

- Price: $15,000
- Client thinks: "Is this worth 100 hours? What if it takes 150 hours?"

Hourly pricing anchors on cost, not value. **Value-based pricing anchors on outcome.**

## Value Equation in Different B2B Contexts

### Scenario 1: CRM Implementation

**Dream Outcome:** "Reduce sales cycle from 90 to 60 days, increasing close rate from 15% to 22%."

**Likelihood:** Case studies from 5 similar companies, project plan with milestones.

**Time Delay:** 90-day implementation with weekly progress updates.

**Effort:** Done-for-you migration, training included.

**Price:** $40K (vs. $300/hour = $48K for 160 hours, but framed on value, not time)

### Scenario 2: Content Marketing Retainer

**Dream Outcome:** "Publish 12 thought leadership articles/year, generate 200 inbound leads."

**Likelihood:** Portfolio of past client articles, traffic/lead data.

**Time Delay:** Monthly cadence, leads start appearing by Month 3.

**Effort:** We write, you approve. 1-hour monthly strategy call.

**Price:** $6K/month ($72K/year for 200 leads = $360/lead vs. $500 CAC via ads)

### Scenario 3: Fractional CFO Services

**Dream Outcome:** "Prepare financials for Series A raise, secure $5M-$10M."

**Likelihood:** 10 past clients who successfully raised (with amounts).

**Time Delay:** 6 months to raise-ready financials.

**Effort:** CFO handles all modeling, reporting, investor deck financials.

**Price:** $15K/month × 6 months = $90K (vs. full-time CFO at $200K/year salary)

## Common Value Equation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Weak Dream Outcome

"I'll optimize your website" is not a dream outcome. "I'll generate 50 inbound leads/month" is.

**Fix:** Always tie to business metrics (revenue, cost, time, risk).

### Mistake 2: Zero Social Proof

New consultants struggle with this. If you have no case studies:

- Offer first 1-2 clients at cost (or free) for testimonials
- Partner with complementary service providers who refer you
- Publish thought leadership (articles, LinkedIn posts) to demonstrate expertise

### Mistake 3: Long Time Horizons Without Milestones

"Results in 12 months" is too distant.

**Fix:** Define 30/60/90-day milestones with tangible outputs.

### Mistake 4: High-Effort Deliverables

Clients won't pay premium prices for "here's a 100-slide deck, now you implement."

**Fix:** Shift to done-for-you or provide plug-and-play tools.

- **Gong** / **Chorus** — Analyze sales calls to identify dream outcomes
- **Notion** / **Coda** — Document case studies and methodologies
- **Loom** — Record async updates (reduces meeting effort)

## Applying Hormozi's Pricing Frameworks

Alex Hormozi advocates **pricing on value captured, not value delivered**.

### Value Ladder Strategy

Stack offers by outcome size:

| Tier | Dream Outcome | Price |
|------|---------------|-------|
| **DIY Course** | Learn SEO fundamentals | $500 |
| **Group Coaching** | Implement SEO with guidance | $5K |
| **Done-With-You** | We plan, you execute | $15K |
| **Done-For-You** | We handle everything | $50K |

Each tier serves different budgets, but outcome quality scales with price.

### The "10X Rule"

Hormozi suggests: **Charge 1/10th of the perceived value.**

If your service generates $500K outcome, charge $50K. Client gets 10:1 ROI, you capture appropriate value.

Most B2B consultants undercharge by 50-80%. They deliver $200K in value, charge $30K, and wonder why clients don't respect them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I'm new and have no case studies?**

Offer 1-2 pro bono or deeply discounted engagements in exchange for detailed testimonials, results data, and referrals. Document everything. Use those to close next 3-5 clients at full price.

**Q: How do I justify value-based pricing to clients used to hourly rates?**

Frame it: "You don't want to pay for hours—you want results. I could spend 200 hours and deliver mediocre outcomes, or 80 hours and 5x your lead flow. Which matters more?"

**Q: What if the client asks for hourly breakdown anyway?**

Provide a rough estimate ("approximately 100-120 hours over 6 months") but anchor on outcome: "The focus is generating 60 leads/month. Hours are implementation details."

**Q: How do I guarantee outcomes without risking my business?**

Offer performance tiers: "If we hit 40-59 leads, you pay 80%. If we hit 60+, full price. If we hit <40, you pay 50%." This shares risk without full exposure.

**Q: Can I use the Value Equation for productized services?**

Yes. Example: "SEO Audit" (productized) → "SEO Audit that identifies $50K in revenue opportunity within 30 days" (value-based positioning).

**Q: What if my service doesn't directly generate revenue?**

Tie to efficiency, risk, or cost savings. Example: "Compliance audit prevents $500K in potential penalties" (risk mitigation).
