# The Fractional Model Explained — Part-Time Executives, Full-Time Impact

**The fractional model** is simple: experienced executives provide part-time, high-level expertise to multiple companies simultaneously. A fractional CFO works 15 hours/month for ClientA, 20 hours/month for ClientB, and 10 hours/month for ClientC—delivering strategic finance leadership without any company paying full-time executive salaries.

This isn't new. Consultants have worked across multiple clients for decades. What's new is the **positioning shift** from "consultant" to "fractional executive." Consultants advise. Fractional executives lead. They make decisions, manage teams, own outcomes, and integrate into company operations as if they were full-time—they're just doing it across three companies instead of one.

The model works because most companies don't need full-time C-level attention. A $3M ARR SaaS company needs strategic CFO guidance 10-15 hours/month: board deck prep, financial model updates, investor relations. They don't need someone in the office 40 hours/week. Hiring full-time means paying $200K+ annually for 10 hours of value delivery and 150 hours of diminishing returns. Hiring fractional means paying $36K-$60K annually for exactly the hours needed.

For the executive, the math is equally compelling. Three fractional clients at $5K/month each = $15K/month = $180K/year. Work 45 hours/month total (15 hours × 3 clients). That's $133/hour effective rate, comparable to consulting firms, with schedule control and equity upside potential if clients offer it.

## The Economics: Why It Works for Both Sides

**From the client's perspective:**

A full-time CMO at a $5M revenue company costs:

- Base salary: $180K-$250K
- Benefits: $40K-$60K (health, 401K, taxes)
- Equity: 0.5-1.5% (vesting over 4 years)
- Total annual cost: $250K-$350K

A fractional CMO delivering equivalent strategic value costs:

- Monthly retainer: $7K-$12K
- Annual cost: $84K-$144K
- Equity: rarely (or much smaller %)

The client saves $100K-$200K annually and gains flexibility. If the relationship isn't working, they terminate with 30 days' notice. Full-time hires require severance, recruitment costs, and operational disruption.

**From the consultant's perspective:**

A CMO earning $200K full-time works 2,000 hours/year (50 weeks × 40 hours) = $100/hour.

A fractional CMO charging $10K/month to three clients earns $360K/year working 540 hours (45 hours/month × 12 months) = $667/hour.

The hourly rate is 6.7x higher, and the consultant works 73% fewer hours. This math assumes the consultant can fill their capacity (a real constraint), but once they do, the economics dwarf traditional employment.

**Why companies pay the premium:**

1. **Access to senior talent** — $5M companies can't afford a $200K CMO. They can afford $10K/month.
2. **Immediate value** — no 3-month onboarding ramp. Fractionals deliver from day one.
3. **Risk reduction** — 30-day termination clauses vs. full-time hiring risk
4. **Specialized expertise** — hire different fractionals for different problems (one for brand positioning, one for demand gen)

## The Typical Engagement Model

Fractional engagements follow patterns based on role and company stage:

**Fractional CFO:**

- **Engagement length:** 6-18 months (covers fundraising cycle, financial system buildout)
- **Hours/month:** 10-20
- **Deliverables:** financial models, board decks, investor relations, accounting process design
- **Exit condition:** company raises next round and hires full-time CFO

**Fractional CMO:**

- **Engagement length:** 6-24 months (covers brand positioning, team hiring, demand system setup)
- **Hours/month:** 15-25
- **Deliverables:** marketing strategy, attribution model, content operations, team hiring/training
- **Exit condition:** company hires VP Marketing or promotes internal candidate

**Fractional COO:**

- **Engagement length:** 6-12 months (process documentation, system implementation)
- **Hours/month:** 15-30
- **Deliverables:** process documentation, org chart design, project management system setup, role definition
- **Exit condition:** operations stabilize, internal candidate promoted

**Fractional CTO:**

- **Engagement length:** 6-18 months (technical architecture, team scaling)
- **Hours/month:** 20-40
- **Deliverables:** technology stack decisions, team hiring, dev process setup, security/compliance
- **Exit condition:** company hires full-time CTO

The pattern: fractional executives bridge gaps. They build systems, hire teams, and create infrastructure that the next full-time executive inherits. They're not long-term replacements—they're accelerators.

## What Fractional Executives Actually Do

Fractionals don't do execution-level work. They design systems, make strategic decisions, and manage teams who execute.

**Example: Fractional CMO responsibilities**

**Not doing:**
- Writing blog posts
- Managing social media accounts
- Running Facebook ads
- Designing graphics

**Actually doing:**
- Designing content strategy and editorial calendar
- Hiring content writer and social media manager
- Selecting marketing automation platform (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot)
- Building attribution model to track campaign ROI
- Presenting marketing performance to board

The distinction matters. Clients who want execution hire agencies or freelancers. Clients who want strategy and team leadership hire fractionals.

**Exception:** Some fractionals offer hybrid models (strategy + execution) at premium pricing. This works for specialized skills (e.g., fractional CTO who also codes) but risks commoditization.

## The Capacity Math: Managing Multiple Clients

The limiting factor in fractional work is **context switching**. Managing five clients simultaneously means five different contexts, teams, goals, and communication threads.

**Capacity management strategies:**

1. **Client batching** — dedicate full days to one client
   - Monday: ClientA
   - Tuesday: ClientB
   - Wednesday: ClientC
   - Thursday: internal business development
   - Friday: overflow + planning

2. **Asynchronous communication** — limit meetings to 1-2/week per client, handle the rest via Slack/email

3. **Systemized deliverables** — use templates for recurring outputs (board decks, status reports) to reduce cognitive load

4. **Maximum client count** — most fractionals cap at 3-5 clients to preserve quality

The math:

- 3 clients × 15 hours = 45 hours/month (sustainable)
- 5 clients × 10 hours = 50 hours/month (approaching limit)
- 7 clients × 8 hours = 56 hours/month (burnout risk)

Beyond five clients, quality degrades. Responses slow, strategic thinking suffers, and clients notice.

## The Sales Cycle and Client Acquisition

Fractional engagements have longer sales cycles than project consulting. Buyers are hiring for strategic roles, not one-off projects. Expect 30-90 days from first conversation to signed contract.

**Typical sales process:**

1. **Discovery call (30 min)** — understand client's problem, stage, and budget
2. **Proposal (written)** — scope of work, deliverables, timeline, pricing
3. **Follow-up call (30 min)** — address questions, negotiate terms
4. **Contract + kickoff (1 week)** — sign agreement, schedule first working session

**Lead sources for fractional work:**

- **Referrals** (40-60% of deals) — past clients, peer consultants, industry connections
- **LinkedIn content** (20-30%) — thought leadership posts, vertical-specific insights
- **Inbound SEO** (10-20%) — ranking for "[vertical] fractional [role]"
- **Outbound** (10-20%) — cold email, LinkedIn outreach to target buyers

Referrals convert highest (50%+ close rate). Outbound converts lowest (5-10%). Most fractionals start with outbound, build a portfolio, then shift to referral-driven business.

## Pricing Models and Rate Structure

Fractional consultants use three pricing structures:

**1. Hourly ($150-$500/hour)**

Pros: Easy to understand, flexible for scope changes
Cons: Caps income (limited hours), feels transactional

Best for: Early-stage fractionals building track record

**2. Monthly retainer ($5K-$20K/month)**

Pros: Predictable revenue, perceived as strategic partnership
Cons: Scope creep risk, requires clear boundaries

Best for: Established fractionals with proven demand

**3. Project-based ($20K-$100K for defined outcomes)**

Pros: Outcome-focused, premium pricing, clear deliverables
Cons: Longer sales cycle, requires strong positioning

Best for: Specialists solving defined problems (e.g., "build Series B financial model")

Most fractionals start hourly, transition to retainers after 3-5 clients, then offer project pricing for repeatable engagements.

**Rate determinants:**

- **Role seniority** — CFO/CMO command higher rates than Director-level fractionals
- **Vertical specialization** — niche expertise (e.g., "SaaS CFO") commands premium
- **Outcomes** — performance-based pricing (revenue %, equity) can 10x traditional rates
- **Geography** — SF/NYC rates 30-50% higher than regional markets

## Contract Structure and Legal Protections

Fractional engagements require clear contracts to prevent scope creep, payment disputes, and liability issues.

**Essential contract clauses:**

1. **Scope of work** — specific deliverables, not vague "strategic guidance"
2. **Hours/month cap** — "15 hours/month, additional hours billed at $X/hour"
3. **Payment terms** — "Due within 15 days of invoice, late fees 1.5%/month"
4. **Termination** — "Either party may terminate with 30 days' written notice"
5. **IP ownership** — "Client owns all work product created during engagement"
6. **Liability cap** — "Consultant liability capped at fees paid in prior 12 months"
7. **Non-solicitation** — "Client won't hire consultant's other clients for 12 months"

Use a lawyer to draft a master services agreement (MSA). Reuse for all clients, customizing scope/pricing via statement of work (SOW) addendums.

## Transitioning to Full-Time or Exiting Gracefully

Most fractional engagements end in one of three ways:

**1. Client hires full-time replacement** (50%)

You've built systems, hired team, proven the function's value. Company raises capital and hires full-time. You transition over 30-60 days.

**2. Scope stabilizes, engagement ends** (30%)

Problem solved, systems operational, no ongoing need. You document outcomes, hand off to internal team, exit cleanly.

**3. Extended retainer** (20%)

Some companies keep fractionals indefinitely at reduced hours (5-10/month) for strategic oversight. This creates annuity revenue.

**Graceful exit protocol:**

- Give 60 days' notice (double contract minimum)
- Offer to help recruit full-time replacement
- Document all processes, credentials, and ongoing projects
- Remain available for 90 days post-exit for questions
- Request testimonial and permission to use as case study

Smooth transitions generate referrals. Abrupt exits damage reputation.

## FAQ

**Is fractional work sustainable long-term?**

Yes. Many consultants operate fractionally for 10+ years. The model works if you can consistently fill capacity and manage client turnover (expect 30-50% annual churn).

**Can fractional consultants take equity instead of cash?**

Sometimes. Early-stage startups offer 0.1-0.5% equity in lieu of 30-50% cash fees. Evaluate using: "Would I invest cash at this valuation?" If no, don't take equity.

**How do fractionals avoid burnout with multiple clients?**

Strict boundaries. No evening/weekend work. Asynchronous communication. Maximum 3-4 clients simultaneously. Say no to bad-fit prospects.

**What's the difference between fractional and interim executives?**

Interim = temporary full-time replacement during search/transition (40 hours/week, 3-6 months). Fractional = ongoing part-time strategic role (10-20 hours/month, 6-24 months).

**Do fractional executives need insurance?**

Yes. Professional liability insurance (E&O) is essential. Costs $1,500-$3,000/year for $1M-$2M coverage. Protects against client claims of negligent advice.
