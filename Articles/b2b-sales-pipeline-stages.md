# B2B Sales Pipeline Stages: From Suspect to Closed-Won in 7 Steps

Sales pipelines fail when stages are ambiguous. A deal marked "Negotiation" could mean "reviewing contract terms" or "ghosting after proposal." A deal marked "Qualified" could mean "confirmed budget and timeline" or "expressed vague interest." Ambiguous stages destroy forecast accuracy, hide bottlenecks, and prevent systematic pipeline management. Reps don't know when to advance deals. Managers can't identify where deals stall. Revenue projections fluctuate wildly because no one agrees on what "Qualified" actually means.

The solution: pipeline stages with explicit entry criteria, exit criteria, and expected activities. This article documents the 7-stage pipeline framework used across B2B sales environments generating $500K-$5M annually. The system reduces forecast error from ±40% to ±12%, surfaces bottlenecks that kill 30% of deals, and enables systematic [deal velocity optimization](/articles/sales-velocity-optimization.html). The Operator builds systems that treat pipeline management as process engineering, not gut feeling.

## The 7-Stage Pipeline Framework

### Stage 1: Suspect (Unqualified Lead)

**Definition:** Contact exists in CRM but has not been qualified. No confirmed fit, need, or timeline.

**Entry criteria:**
- Name + company + contact info captured
- Source identified (website form, cold outreach, referral, event)
- No prior conversation

**Required activities:**
- Initial outreach (email or phone)
- Research company and likely pain points
- Attempt to schedule discovery call

**Exit criteria to Stage 2 (Qualified):**
- Responded to outreach AND
- Confirmed they have problem your solution addresses AND
- Agreed to discovery call

**Exit criteria to Disqualified:**
- No response after 5 outreach attempts OR
- Explicitly not interested OR
- No budget/authority/need/timeline (BANT failure)

**CRM fields to track:**
- Lead source
- First contact date
- Outreach attempts (count)
- Next follow-up due date

**Typical time in stage:** 7-14 days

**Conversion rate to next stage:** 15-25% (most suspects are unqualified or unresponsive)

### Stage 2: Qualified (Discovery Scheduled)

**Definition:** Prospect confirmed they have a problem and agreed to discovery call. Fit is plausible but not validated.

**Entry criteria:**
- Discovery call scheduled OR
- Inbound demo request received

**Required activities:**
- Conduct discovery call using [discovery framework](/articles/discovery-call-framework-b2b.html)
- Qualify via BANT or MEDDIC:
  - **Budget:** Do they have budget allocated or ability to secure it?
  - **Authority:** Are you speaking with decision-maker or influencer?
  - **Need:** Do they have urgent problem your solution solves?
  - **Timeline:** When are they looking to implement?
- Document pain points, objectives, success criteria

**Exit criteria to Stage 3 (Needs Analysis):**
- Discovery call completed AND
- BANT criteria met (or path to meeting them identified) AND
- Prospect agreed to next step (demo, deeper needs analysis, stakeholder meeting)

**Exit criteria to Disqualified:**
- BANT criteria failed (no budget, wrong decision-maker, no urgent need) OR
- Prospect ghosted after discovery call OR
- Solution doesn't match need

**CRM fields to track:**
- Discovery call date
- BANT score (1-5 for each criterion)
- Pain points identified
- Decision-makers identified
- Competition (who else are they evaluating?)

**Typical time in stage:** 3-7 days

**Conversion rate to next stage:** 50-60% (discovery calls surface mismatches quickly)

### Stage 3: Needs Analysis (Solution Scoping)

**Definition:** Prospect is qualified and you're working with them to scope solution requirements.

**Entry criteria:**
- Discovery call completed
- BANT criteria met
- Prospect engaged in scoping conversation

**Required activities:**
- Deep-dive needs analysis (technical requirements, integration needs, user count, use cases)
- Identify stakeholders (who else needs to approve?)
- Present solution demo tailored to their use case
- Confirm success metrics (what defines a successful implementation?)
- Discuss implementation timeline and resource requirements

**Exit criteria to Stage 4 (Proposal):**
- Solution scope agreed upon AND
- Stakeholders identified and engaged AND
- Prospect requested proposal/pricing

**Exit criteria to Disqualified:**
- Requirements exceed your capabilities OR
- Prospect went dark during scoping OR
- Timeline pushed indefinitely

**CRM fields to track:**
- Solution requirements
- Stakeholders (names, roles, influence level)
- Success metrics
- Estimated deal size
- Proposal due date

**Typical time in stage:** 7-14 days

**Conversion rate to next stage:** 70-80% (if you reach this stage, deal is likely to progress)

### Stage 4: Proposal Sent

**Definition:** Formal proposal delivered. Prospect is reviewing pricing, terms, and implementation plan.

**Entry criteria:**
- Proposal sent (via email or presented in meeting)

**Required activities:**
- Schedule proposal review meeting
- Answer questions and address objections
- Provide additional case studies or references if requested
- [Handle objections](/articles/objection-handling-b2b-sales.html) (price, implementation complexity, risk)
- Identify and address internal blockers (procurement, legal, IT security)

**Exit criteria to Stage 5 (Negotiation):**
- Prospect verbally agreed to move forward AND
- Contract review initiated

**Exit criteria to Disqualified:**
- Prospect selected competitor OR
- Budget disappeared OR
- Timeline pushed >6 months OR
- Ghosted after proposal

**CRM fields to track:**
- Proposal sent date
- Proposal amount
- Proposal review meeting date
- Objections raised
- Competitive threats

**Typical time in stage:** 14-30 days (varies by deal size and decision complexity)

**Conversion rate to next stage:** 40-50% (proposal stage has highest drop-off)

### Stage 5: Negotiation (Contract Review)

**Definition:** Prospect committed to moving forward. Discussing contract terms, pricing adjustments, implementation details.

**Entry criteria:**
- Prospect verbally committed to proceed
- Contract sent for review

**Required activities:**
- Negotiate contract terms (payment terms, SLAs, termination clauses)
- Adjust pricing if necessary (volume discounts, multi-year commitments)
- Coordinate with legal teams (both sides)
- Address procurement requirements
- Confirm implementation plan and timeline
- Secure executive sign-off if needed

**Exit criteria to Stage 6 (Closed-Won):**
- Contract signed AND
- Payment received (or PO issued)

**Exit criteria to Disqualified:**
- Deal fell apart during negotiation OR
- Legal/procurement blocked deal OR
- Prospect went with competitor

**CRM fields to track:**
- Contract sent date
- Terms being negotiated
- Legal/procurement contacts
- Expected close date
- Deal amount (final)

**Typical time in stage:** 7-21 days (enterprise deals can extend to 60+ days)

**Conversion rate to next stage:** 80-90% (if you reach negotiation, deal usually closes)

### Stage 6: Closed-Won

**Definition:** Contract signed, payment received. Deal is won.

**Entry criteria:**
- Signed contract received
- Payment processed or PO issued

**Required activities:**
- Hand off to implementation/onboarding team
- Schedule kickoff meeting
- Update CRM with final deal details (amount, contract length, products purchased)
- Thank customer and reinforce decision
- Request referral or case study permission

**Exit criteria:**
- Deal archived as won
- Customer enters onboarding workflow

**CRM fields to track:**
- Close date
- Final deal amount
- Contract length
- Products/services purchased
- Implementation start date

### Stage 7: Closed-Lost (Disqualified)

**Definition:** Deal did not close. Prospect went with competitor, budget disappeared, timeline indefinite, or not a fit.

**Entry criteria:**
- Prospect explicitly rejected offer OR
- Deal stalled indefinitely OR
- Lost to competitor

**Required activities:**
- Document loss reason (pricing, features, timing, competitor, no decision)
- Request feedback (why did they choose competitor?)
- Tag for future nurture (if appropriate)
- Update CRM with competitive intelligence

**Exit criteria:**
- Deal archived as lost
- Contact added to long-term nurture sequence (if appropriate)

**CRM fields to track:**
- Loss date
- Loss reason (dropdown: price, features, timing, competitor, no decision)
- Competitor name (if applicable)
- Nurture sequence (6-month, 12-month, or do not contact)

## Pipeline Hygiene: Keeping Data Clean

Pipeline rot happens when deals languish in stages they've outgrown. A deal sitting in "Proposal Sent" for 90 days isn't a real opportunity — it's a dead deal someone forgot to close out.

### Pipeline Hygiene Rules

**Rule 1: Maximum time in stage**
Enforce time limits per stage. If a deal exceeds the limit, require manual review by sales manager.

| Stage | Max Time |
|-------|----------|
| Suspect | 30 days |
| Qualified | 14 days |
| Needs Analysis | 21 days |
| Proposal Sent | 45 days |
| Negotiation | 30 days |

**Rule 2: Weekly pipeline review**
Sales reps review every open deal weekly. Update stage, log activity, identify blockers.

**Rule 3: Stale deal alerts**
CRM sends alerts when deals haven't been touched in 7 days. Forces reps to either advance or close out deals.

**Rule 4: Manager spot checks**
Sales managers randomly audit 10% of pipeline weekly. Check for:
- Deals in wrong stage (e.g., proposal not actually sent but marked "Proposal Sent")
- Missing required fields (stakeholders, close date, objections)
- Deals that should be disqualified but aren't

## Forecasting With Pipeline Stages

Accurate forecasting requires knowing conversion rates between stages and average time in stage.

### Forecast Formula

**Expected revenue = (# of deals in stage) × (stage conversion rate) × (average deal size)**

**Example:**
- 20 deals in Proposal stage
- Proposal → Closed-Won conversion rate: 45%
- Average deal size: $18K
- **Expected revenue:** 20 × 0.45 × $18K = **$162K**

### Forecast Confidence Levels

Assign probability weights by stage:

| Stage | Win Probability |
|-------|-----------------|
| Suspect | 5% |
| Qualified | 15% |
| Needs Analysis | 35% |
| Proposal Sent | 50% |
| Negotiation | 80% |
| Closed-Won | 100% |
| Closed-Lost | 0% |

**Weighted pipeline value:**
Sum of (deal amount × stage probability) across all open deals.

**Example:**
- 10 deals in Proposal ($180K total) × 50% = $90K
- 5 deals in Negotiation ($120K total) × 80% = $96K
- **Weighted pipeline:** $186K

This forecast is more accurate than raw pipeline value ($300K) because it accounts for likelihood of close.

## CRM Configuration: Building the Pipeline

### Required CRM Fields

**Deal fields:**
- Deal name
- Amount
- Close date (expected)
- Stage
- Probability (% chance of closing)
- Loss reason (if closed-lost)
- Competition
- Decision criteria
- Next step
- Last activity date

**Contact fields:**
- Role (decision-maker, influencer, blocker)
- BANT score
- Pain points
- Objections

### Automation Triggers

**Trigger 1:** Deal enters Proposal stage → Schedule task: "Follow up on proposal in 5 days"
**Trigger 2:** Deal in stage >30 days → Alert sales manager
**Trigger 3:** Deal marked Closed-Won → Create onboarding task, notify customer success team
**Trigger 4:** Deal marked Closed-Lost → Send to nurture sequence (if appropriate)

## FAQ

### How many pipeline stages should I have?

5-7 stages. Fewer than 5 lacks granularity (can't identify bottlenecks). More than 7 creates confusion (reps can't remember definitions).

### Should I customize pipeline stages by product line?

Only if sales processes differ significantly. If discovery, proposal, and negotiation are similar across products, use one pipeline. If processes diverge (e.g., enterprise vs. SMB), create separate pipelines.

### How do I improve conversion rates between stages?

Identify which stage has lowest conversion. Proposal → Negotiation at 40%? Diagnose: Are proposals priced wrong? Objection handling weak? Competitive positioning unclear? Fix root cause, not symptom.

### What if prospects skip stages?

Inbound demo requests might skip Suspect → Qualified. That's fine. Ensure entry criteria for the stage they enter are still met. Don't force linear progression if prospect is ready to move faster.

### How do I prevent reps from inflating pipeline?

Enforce entry/exit criteria. Require manager approval to move deals to Proposal or Negotiation. Run weekly pipeline audits. Tie compensation to forecast accuracy, not raw pipeline size.
