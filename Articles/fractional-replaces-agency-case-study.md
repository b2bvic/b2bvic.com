# How Fractional Replaces Agency Model — Real Estate Brokerage Case Study

**The scenario:** A 40-agent residential real estate brokerage in North Carolina was paying a marketing agency $7,000/month for social media management, email campaigns, and Google Ads. After 18 months, the relationship wasn't delivering. Leads were stagnant, agents didn't use the content, and the agency operated as a black box—delivering reports but no strategic input or accountability.

The broker explored alternatives and hired a fractional CMO at $5,000/month for 15 hours of strategic oversight. Within six months, organic lead volume increased 40%, agent adoption of marketing systems went from 20% to 75%, and cost-per-lead dropped 35%. The difference wasn't execution quality—it was strategic leadership, internal team development, and alignment with business goals.

This case study illustrates when fractional consulting displaces agencies: when clients need strategy and team-building more than outsourced execution.

## The Agency Model and Its Limitations

Marketing agencies sell execution: they create content, manage ad campaigns, design graphics, and produce reports. For companies with clear strategies and execution gaps, agencies work well. For companies without strategy, agencies execute tactically without business impact.

**The brokerage's agency relationship breakdown:**

1. **No strategic oversight** — agency executed tasks from a checklist (post 3x/week, send monthly newsletter, run Google Ads) without connecting activity to business goals
2. **Misaligned KPIs** — agency reported impressions, reach, and engagement. Brokerage needed leads, appointments, and closings
3. **Zero internal capability** — agents didn't understand the marketing system. When the agency posted, agents didn't share or engage. Content felt generic.
4. **Poor communication** — monthly reports with no discussion of what was working or failing. No optimization, just delivery.
5. **Retention pressure** — agency optimized for client retention (happy reports) not client outcomes (revenue growth)

The brokerage wasn't getting bad service. They were getting the wrong service for their maturity stage. They needed strategy and team development, not outsourced execution.

## Why Fractional Worked Better

The fractional CMO model flipped the approach: instead of executing marketing, the fractional CMO designed the system, hired internal talent, and held the team accountable. Execution stayed in-house (lower cost, higher alignment). Strategy came from the fractional (high expertise, part-time cost).

**Fractional engagement structure:**

- **15 hours/month** at $5,000 = $333/hour effective rate
- **Meetings:** Bi-weekly strategy calls (1 hour), monthly agent training (1 hour), quarterly board presentations
- **Deliverables:** Marketing strategy roadmap, hiring specs for marketing coordinator, campaign performance reports, agent scorecards

The fractional didn't manage social media or write emails. They built the system that enabled the brokerage to do it themselves.

## Month 1-2: Audit and Strategy Foundation

The fractional's first step was diagnosing what the agency had built and where it failed.

**Audit findings:**

1. **Social media content** was generic (stock photos, motivational quotes, national real estate stats). It didn't feature the brokerage's agents, listings, or local market insights. Engagement was 0.5% (well below 3-5% industry benchmark).

2. **Email campaigns** went to a 12,000-person list, but open rates were 8% (vs. 20-25% industry average). Subject lines were templated ("Your Monthly Market Update"). No segmentation by buyer/seller, location, or engagement history.

3. **Google Ads** spent $2,500/month generating 40 leads/month ($62.50 cost-per-lead). No follow-up system existed—leads entered Follow Up Boss CRM and sat uncontacted for days.

4. **Agent adoption** was zero. Agents didn't share posts, didn't reference campaigns, and ran personal marketing parallel to brokerage efforts. This fragmented brand presence.

**Root cause diagnosis:**

The agency delivered tactics without strategic alignment. The brokerage's actual goal—generate quality leads and convert them efficiently—wasn't connected to agency deliverables. Social media KPIs (impressions, reach) don't correlate with lead generation. The agency optimized for vanity metrics.

**Strategic recommendations:**

1. **Shift budget from agency execution to internal team** — hire a marketing coordinator at $45K/year ($3,750/month) to execute campaigns under fractional CMO oversight
2. **Refocus content on local market authority** — feature agent listings, neighborhood guides, and hyper-local stats (not generic national trends)
3. **Implement lead response SLA** — all inbound leads contacted within 1 hour, tracked in CRM
4. **Agent training and accountability** — monthly marketing training, agent scorecards showing engagement with marketing assets

The broker approved the plan. The agency contract was terminated with 30 days' notice.

## Month 3-4: Team Hiring and System Build

The fractional CMO wrote the job spec for a marketing coordinator and ran the hiring process. The role combined execution (social media posting, email campaigns, light graphic design) with CRM management (ensuring leads were followed up).

**Hired candidate:**

- 3 years experience in real estate marketing (understood agent workflows)
- Proficient in Canva, Mailchimp, and basic CRM operations
- Salary: $45K + benefits = $55K total annual cost ($4,583/month)

**Total marketing spend after transition:**

- Fractional CMO: $5,000/month
- Marketing coordinator: $4,583/month
- Ad spend (Google, Facebook): $2,500/month
- **Total: $12,083/month** (vs. $9,500 with agency model)

The budget increased $2,583/month, but the value output was fundamentally different. The brokerage now had strategic leadership, internal capability, and direct control.

**System buildout:**

1. **Content calendar** — 4 weeks planned in advance, featuring agent listings, market updates, and client testimonials
2. **Email segmentation** — split lists by buyer/seller, location, and engagement history. Personalized subject lines and CTAs.
3. **Lead response SLA** — Follow Up Boss automation + manual oversight. Uncontacted leads flagged daily, assigned to agents with accountability.
4. **Agent scorecards** — monthly reports showing each agent's lead volume, response time, and conversion rate

## Month 5-6: Results and Optimization

After 90 days of the new system operating, the brokerage measured outcomes:

**Lead generation:**

- Pre-fractional: 40 leads/month at $62.50 CPL
- Post-fractional: 65 leads/month at $38.46 CPL (+62% volume, -38% cost)

**Improvement drivers:**

- Better ad targeting (local intent keywords vs. broad national terms)
- Landing pages optimized for conversion (simplified forms, mobile-first design)
- Retargeting campaigns for website visitors

**Lead conversion:**

- Pre-fractional: 3% of leads converted to appointments (1.2 appointments/month)
- Post-fractional: 8% conversion rate (5.2 appointments/month)

**Improvement drivers:**

- Speed-to-lead improved (92% contacted within 1 hour vs. 40% previously)
- Agent training on lead qualification scripts
- CRM automation reminders prevented leads from languishing

**Agent engagement:**

- Pre-fractional: 20% of agents shared brokerage marketing content
- Post-fractional: 75% of agents shared monthly content at least once

**Improvement drivers:**

- Content featured agents directly (they were proud to share it)
- Monthly training educated agents on how to use content for personal brand-building
- Scorecards created peer accountability (public visibility of who engaged)

**Financial impact:**

- Additional 4 appointments/month × 15% close rate × $8,000 avg commission = $4,800/month additional revenue
- Cost increase: $2,583/month (fractional model vs. agency model)
- **Net monthly gain: $2,217** (86% ROI on incremental spend)

Annualized: $26,604 additional revenue from marketing optimization.

## Why the Fractional Model Worked Here

The success wasn't about execution quality. The agency had competent designers and ad buyers. The fractional model worked because:

**1. Strategic oversight aligned marketing with business goals**

The agency optimized for engagement. The fractional optimized for lead generation and conversion. This required understanding the brokerage's revenue model, agent capacity, and CRM workflows—context the agency never had.

**2. Internal team development created long-term capability**

The marketing coordinator learned under fractional guidance, building institutional knowledge. When the fractional exits (6-12 months), the brokerage retains the system and the trained employee. With the agency, everything left when the contract ended.

**3. Agent buy-in came from co-creation**

Agents saw themselves in the content (their listings, their wins, their testimonials). This created pride and participation. Agency-created content felt external, not "ours."

**4. Accountability shifted from outputs to outcomes**

The agency delivered what was contracted (posts, emails, ads). The fractional was accountable for business results (leads, appointments, conversions). This changed incentives.

## When Fractional Replaces Agency (and When It Doesn't)

This case study illustrates a pattern: **fractional works when the client needs strategy and team-building more than outsourced execution**.

**Fractional is the better choice when:**

- Company lacks internal marketing/ops/finance expertise and needs to build it
- Existing agency delivers tactics without strategic oversight
- Company wants to own IP and capability (not rent it)
- Leadership has capacity to manage an internal team with fractional guidance

**Agency is the better choice when:**

- Company has clear strategy and needs execution bandwidth
- Company lacks time/interest in managing internal team
- Seasonal or project-based needs (not ongoing)
- Specialized execution skills required (video production, SEO technical audits)

**Hybrid model (fractional + agency):**

Some companies use fractional for strategy and agencies for specialized execution:

- Fractional CMO designs strategy
- SEO agency executes technical audits and link-building
- Content writer produces blog posts
- Fractional CMO coordinates and holds all parties accountable

This works when the fractional acts as the integrator and owns outcomes.

## The Transition Playbook

If you're considering replacing an agency with a fractional model, follow this sequence:

**1. Audit current performance (Month 0)**

- What outcomes matter? (Leads, revenue, conversions—not impressions)
- What's the agency delivering vs. what you need?
- Where are the gaps? (Strategy, team, tools, process)

**2. Hire fractional consultant (Month 1)**

- Define scope: strategy, team hiring, system build, accountability
- Set engagement length: 6-12 months with 30-day termination option
- Establish success metrics: lead volume, conversion rate, cost efficiency

**3. Terminate agency gracefully (Month 1-2)**

- Give contractual notice period
- Request all files, credentials, and documentation
- Thank them professionally (preserve relationship)

**4. Hire internal team (Month 2-3)**

- Fractional writes job specs and manages hiring
- Start with one generalist coordinator, scale later if needed

**5. Build systems and train team (Month 3-4)**

- Document processes, create templates, implement tools
- Train internal team on execution and reporting

**6. Measure and optimize (Month 5-6)**

- Compare pre/post performance on key metrics
- Iterate based on data, not assumptions

**7. Plan fractional exit (Month 9-12)**

- Transition oversight to internal team or hire full-time
- Fractional remains available for quarterly strategic reviews

## FAQ

**How do you convince leadership to replace an established agency?**

Show outcome gaps. If the agency reports "10,000 impressions" but can't show lead volume or revenue impact, that's the wedge. Frame fractional as "strategic oversight + internal capability" not "replacing the agency."

**What if the agency pushes back or bad-mouths the fractional?**

Professional agencies understand client needs evolve. If they push back aggressively, it signals they prioritized retention over outcomes. Proceed with transition.

**Can the fractional and agency work together?**

Yes, if roles are clear: fractional owns strategy, agency executes specific deliverables (SEO, paid ads, video). The fractional must have final authority to prevent misalignment.

**How long should the fractional engagement last?**

6-12 months to build systems and train team. Some companies keep fractionals indefinitely at reduced hours (5-10/month) for ongoing strategic oversight.

**What's the financial breakeven on this transition?**

If fractional + internal team costs $2K-$4K/month more than agency, you need $2K-$4K/month incremental revenue to break even. Most case studies show 2x-5x ROI within six months due to better lead conversion and lower customer acquisition costs.
