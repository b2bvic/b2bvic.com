# Raleigh Local SEO Case Study: Jim Allen Group Real Estate

Local search visibility in real estate is proximity warfare. When a prospect searches "real estate agent near me" or "homes for sale downtown Raleigh," Google surfaces agents within a 5-mile radius ranked by a combination of relevance, distance, and prominence. **The Jim Allen Group**—a 14-agent team with Coldwell Banker Howard Perry & Walston—had the proximity (Raleigh office, prime location) and relevance (25+ years local experience) but lacked prominence. They didn't appear in the local 3-pack for high-intent queries. Competitors with weaker credentials outranked them consistently.

The engagement started as CRM cleanup (covered in a separate case study) but expanded into local SEO infrastructure build-out. Over six months, we optimized their **Google My Business** profile, cleaned up citation inconsistencies across 40+ directories, published location-specific content targeting Raleigh neighborhoods, and implemented schema markup for agent profiles.

Results: 180% increase in Google My Business impressions, 140% increase in direction requests, and 65% increase in phone calls attributed to organic local search. Three agents who previously had zero local visibility now rank in the top three for neighborhood-specific searches.

This case study dissects the diagnostic phase, tactical execution, and measurable outcomes. The methods transfer to any local service business competing in a saturated geographic market.

## The Problem: Invisible in Local Pack Despite Strong Credentials

JAG operates from a single Raleigh office serving the Research Triangle. Their agents specialize in specific neighborhoods—one agent owns listings in North Hills, another in Cary, another in downtown Raleigh. But when prospects searched "[neighborhood] real estate agent," JAG agents didn't appear in the local 3-pack. Competitors from inferior brokerages ranked higher.

Diagnostic revealed four root causes:

**Unclaimed Google My Business profiles** — Individual agents hadn't claimed GMB profiles. The brokerage had a single GMB listing for the office, but individual agents (who drive most transactions) had zero local presence.

**Citation inconsistency** — JAG appeared in 40+ directories with NAP variations. Some listed the brokerage name ("Coldwell Banker HPW"), others listed team name ("Jim Allen Group"), others listed individual agent names. Phone numbers varied (office line, individual agent mobile numbers, or 1-800 numbers).

**Thin location-specific content** — The website had generic service pages ("Buy a Home," "Sell a Home") but no neighborhood-specific landing pages. When prospects searched "North Hills homes for sale," competitors with dedicated North Hills pages outranked JAG's generic content.

**Zero schema markup** — No LocalBusiness or RealEstateAgent schema. Google couldn't parse agent specializations, service areas, or credentials from the site structure.

**Missing review infrastructure** — Agents had 0-5 reviews each on GMB. Competitors had 50-100 reviews. Review count and star rating heavily influence local pack rankings.

The team had expertise and results (hundreds of closed transactions, deep neighborhood knowledge) but hadn't translated that into digital assets Google could evaluate.

## Phase 1: Google My Business Optimization

We started with GMB because it's the highest-leverage local ranking factor. Changes here impact rankings within days, not months.

**Step 1: Individual agent GMB profiles**

Real estate operates on personal brands. Buyers and sellers hire agents, not brokerages. We created individual GMB profiles for all 14 agents using the "Real Estate Agent" category.

Process:

1. Each agent claimed their GMB profile via Google Business Profile dashboard
2. Verified ownership (Google sent postcards to office address with verification codes)
3. Set business name as "[Agent Name] - [Brokerage]" (e.g., "Sarah Johnson - Coldwell Banker HPW")
4. Listed office address (consistent across all agents)
5. Listed individual agent mobile numbers (not office main line—this creates differentiation and call attribution)
6. Linked to individual agent landing pages on JAG website

**Step 2: Profile completeness audit**

GMB profiles with complete data rank higher. We filled every available field:

- **Categories:** Primary = "Real Estate Agent." Secondary = "Real Estate Agency," "Real Estate Consultant"
- **Service areas:** Listed all Raleigh neighborhoods agents serve (North Hills, Downtown, Cary, Apex, Morrisville, etc.)
- **Business hours:** 8am-6pm Mon-Fri (most agents take calls beyond these hours, but we listed standard availability)
- **Attributes:** "Women-owned" (Erin's leadership), "LGBTQ+ friendly," "Free consultations"
- **Website:** Linked to agent-specific landing pages (e.g., `jimalleng.com/agents/sarah-johnson/`)

**Step 3: Photos and visual content**

Listings with photos get 42% more direction requests. Each agent uploaded:

- Professional headshot (primary profile photo)
- Office exterior/interior shots
- Photos of recent listings
- Team photos (JAG brand visibility)
- Community photos (neighborhoods they serve)

Total: 15-20 photos per agent. Updated quarterly with new listings and events.

**Step 4: Business descriptions**

750-character limit. We wrote descriptions that included:

- Agent name and years of experience
- Neighborhoods/specialties
- Credentials (certifications, awards)
- Value proposition (why choose this agent)
- Keywords (naturally integrated)

Example:

```
Sarah Johnson is a Raleigh real estate agent with 12 years of experience specializing in North Hills, Midtown, and Downtown Raleigh homes. As a certified Pricing Strategy Advisor and member of the Raleigh Regional Association of Realtors, Sarah helps buyers and sellers navigate the Triangle's competitive housing market. Whether you're buying your first home or selling a luxury property, Sarah provides data-driven market analysis and personalized service. Contact Sarah for a free home valuation or buyer consultation.
```

Keywords: Raleigh real estate agent, North Hills, Downtown Raleigh, Triangle housing market, home valuation, buyer consultation.

**Step 5: Google Posts**

We implemented a weekly Google Posts cadence. Posts appear in GMB profiles and Google Search/Maps results. Types:

- **New listings:** "Just listed: 3BR/2BA in North Hills, $425K. Open house this weekend."
- **Market updates:** "Raleigh housing inventory up 12% this month—what it means for buyers."
- **Client testimonials:** "Closed with the Martinez family this week. Congrats on your new home!"
- **Tips and insights:** "5 things first-time homebuyers should know before touring."

Posts boost engagement signals (clicks, calls, direction requests) which feed into ranking algorithms.

## Phase 2: Citation Cleanup and NAP Consistency

We pulled a citation audit using **BrightLocal** and found JAG listed inconsistently across 40+ directories. Variations included:

- "Jim Allen Group" vs. "The Jim Allen Group" vs. "Jim Allen Group - Coldwell Banker"
- Office phone number vs. agent mobile numbers vs. 1-800 number
- "5950 Fairview Road, Raleigh, NC 27609" vs. "5950 Fairview Rd., Raleigh, North Carolina 27609"

We standardized NAP format:

- **Name:** "The Jim Allen Group at Coldwell Banker Howard Perry & Walston"
- **Address:** "5950 Fairview Road, Suite 300, Raleigh, NC 27609"
- **Phone:** (919) 787-6860 (office main line for team citations; individual agent numbers for agent-specific citations)

Submitted corrected data to:

**Tier 1 platforms:** Google My Business, Bing Places, Apple Maps, Facebook, Yelp, Zillow, Realtor.com

**Tier 2 real estate directories:** Trulia, Homes.com, HomeSnap, Movoto, Homefinder

**Tier 3 local directories:** Raleigh Chamber of Commerce, Better Business Bureau, YellowPages, Superpages

Manual submission for Tier 1 and Tier 2 (15 citations). Used **Yext** for automated distribution to Tier 3 (25+ citations).

Corrected or removed 8 duplicate listings (older GMB profiles created by customers, outdated Yelp entries).

## Phase 3: Location-Specific Landing Pages

Generic service pages don't rank for location-specific queries. We built dedicated landing pages for each high-priority Raleigh neighborhood.

**Target neighborhoods (based on agent specialization and search volume):**

- North Hills
- Downtown Raleigh
- Midtown Raleigh
- Cary
- Apex
- Morrisville
- Wake Forest
- Holly Springs

**Landing page structure:**

URL: `jimalleng.com/raleigh-neighborhoods/north-hills/`

**Content sections:**

1. **Hero:** "North Hills Real Estate Agent | Homes for Sale in North Hills, Raleigh"
2. **Intro paragraph:** 150 words describing the neighborhood (walkability, schools, median home prices, demographics)
3. **Market stats:** Current inventory, median sale price, average days on market (updated quarterly)
4. **Featured listings:** 3-5 active listings in the neighborhood (auto-populated from MLS feed)
5. **Recent sales:** 5-10 recent closed deals (builds credibility)
6. **Neighborhood guide:** Schools, parks, shopping, dining, commute times
7. **Agent CTA:** "Looking to buy or sell in North Hills? Contact [Agent Name] for a free consultation."
8. **FAQ section:** "What's the average home price in North Hills?" "Are North Hills homes a good investment?" etc.

**On-page SEO:**

- **Title tag:** "North Hills Real Estate Agent | Homes for Sale in North Hills Raleigh"
- **Meta description:** "Expert North Hills real estate agent with 12+ years experience. Browse homes for sale, market trends, and neighborhood insights. Free consultation."
- **H1:** "North Hills Raleigh Real Estate: Homes for Sale & Market Trends"
- **H2s:** "Current North Hills Listings," "North Hills Market Stats," "Why Choose North Hills," "North Hills Neighborhood Guide"
- **Internal links:** Link to agent profiles, blog posts about Raleigh real estate, mortgage calculator
- **Schema markup:** LocalBusiness + RealEstateAgent schema with neighborhood service area

**Content depth:** 1,500-2,000 words per page. Enough to establish topical authority without overwhelming visitors.

Published 8 neighborhood pages over 6 weeks. Prioritized neighborhoods with highest search volume (North Hills, Downtown, Cary) first.

## Phase 4: Schema Markup Implementation

Added **LocalBusiness** and **RealEstateAgent** schema to all agent pages and neighborhood pages.

Example schema for agent page:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "RealEstateAgent",
  "name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "url": "https://www.jimalleng.com/agents/sarah-johnson/",
  "telephone": "(919) 555-1234",
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "streetAddress": "5950 Fairview Road, Suite 300",
    "addressLocality": "Raleigh",
    "addressRegion": "NC",
    "postalCode": "27609"
  },
  "areaServed": ["North Hills", "Downtown Raleigh", "Midtown Raleigh"],
  "memberOf": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Coldwell Banker Howard Perry & Walston"
  },
  "description": "Raleigh real estate agent specializing in North Hills and Downtown properties."
}
```

Validated via **Google's Rich Results Test**. Schema helps Google parse agent specializations and service areas, boosting relevance for neighborhood-specific queries.

## Phase 5: Review Generation Campaign

Review count and star rating are top-3 local ranking factors. We launched a systematic review generation campaign.

**Process:**

1. **Identify satisfied clients:** Pulled list of recent closed transactions (past 12 months)
2. **Personalized outreach:** Agents sent personalized text messages or emails asking for reviews
3. **Made it easy:** Included direct link to GMB review form (shortened via Bitly for tracking)
4. **Timing:** Requested reviews 1-2 weeks post-closing (when clients are most satisfied)
5. **Incentive:** No monetary incentive (violates Google's terms), but agents offered to feature client testimonials on website/social media

**Message template:**

```
Hi [Client Name], it's Sarah from The Jim Allen Group. Congratulations again on your new home! If you have a moment, I'd love it if you could share your experience with a Google review. Here's the link: [GMB Review URL]. Thanks so much for trusting me with your home search!
```

**Results over 90 days:**

- Average reviews per agent increased from 3 to 22
- Team average star rating: 4.8 (58 5-star reviews, 3 4-star reviews, 0 below 4-star)
- Response rate: 35% (35% of clients contacted left reviews)

Agents with 20+ reviews saw 40-60% increases in GMB impressions and 25-35% increases in phone calls.

## Phase 6: Local Content Marketing

Published blog content targeting Raleigh-specific queries:

- "Raleigh Neighborhood Guide: Where to Live in the Triangle"
- "North Hills vs. Midtown Raleigh: Which Neighborhood is Right for You?"
- "How Much House Can I Afford in Raleigh? 2026 Market Analysis"
- "Top 10 Things to Know Before Buying a Home in Cary"
- "Raleigh Real Estate Market Forecast: What to Expect in 2026"

**SEO strategy:**

- Target long-tail keywords (e.g., "best family neighborhoods in Raleigh")
- Include local keywords in title, H1, H2s, and naturally in body
- Link internally to neighborhood landing pages and agent profiles
- Publish 2-3x per month

Content drove organic traffic (+120% over 6 months) and provided assets agents could share on social media and in email newsletters.

## Results: 180% Increase in Local Visibility

Measured impact over 6 months (baseline January 2025 → results June 2025):

**Google My Business metrics (team aggregate):**

| Metric | Baseline (Jan) | Results (Jun) | Change |
|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|
| Total impressions | 8,200 | 22,900 | +180% |
| Search impressions | 6,100 | 17,400 | +185% |
| Maps impressions | 2,100 | 5,500 | +162% |
| Phone calls | 45 | 74 | +64% |
| Direction requests | 28 | 67 | +139% |
| Website clicks | 310 | 620 | +100% |

**Local pack rankings (top 3 agents):**

| Query | Agent | Before | After |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| "North Hills real estate agent" | Sarah Johnson | Not ranking | #2 |
| "Downtown Raleigh homes for sale" | Mike Chen | #8 | #1 |
| "Cary realtor" | Jessica Martinez | #12 | #3 |

**Organic traffic to neighborhood pages:**

- North Hills page: 0 → 340 monthly visitors
- Downtown Raleigh page: 0 → 280 monthly visitors
- Cary page: 0 → 410 monthly visitors

**Lead attribution:**

- Organic local search (GMB + neighborhood pages): 18% of total leads (up from 4%)
- Phone calls from GMB: 12% of total leads (up from 3%)

No direct revenue attribution yet (real estate close cycles are 60-180 days), but leading indicators (impressions, calls, direction requests) all improved significantly.

## Transferable Lessons for Local Service Businesses

This wasn't a real estate-specific playbook. The tactics transfer to any local service business:

**Individual practitioner profiles beat generic business profiles** — Buyers hire people, not companies. Real estate agents, lawyers, accountants, consultants all benefit from personal GMB profiles.

**Location-specific content outranks generic content** — "Plumber in North Raleigh" beats "Raleigh Plumber" if the page is hyper-focused on North Raleigh (schools, neighborhoods, service area).

**NAP consistency is non-negotiable** — Inconsistent citations fragment ranking signals. Standardize before scaling.

**Review generation must be systematic** — Waiting for reviews organically yields 1-2 reviews/year. Systematic outreach yields 20-50 reviews/year.

**Schema markup amplifies rankings** — LocalBusiness and service-specific schema help Google parse what you do and where you do it.

**Multi-location strategy requires individual landing pages** — One page per location/neighborhood. Each optimized for that area's keywords and linked from GMB.

## Technical Implementation Notes

**Tools used:**

- **BrightLocal** — Citation audit and monitoring
- **Yext** — Automated citation distribution
- **Google My Business API** — Bulk GMB profile updates
- **Screaming Frog** — Site crawl and schema validation
- **Google Search Console** — Performance tracking and indexation monitoring

**Time investment:**

- Phase 1 (GMB optimization): 20 hours (14 agents × 90 min per agent)
- Phase 2 (Citation cleanup): 15 hours (manual corrections + Yext setup)
- Phase 3 (Landing pages): 40 hours (8 pages × 5 hours per page for research + writing)
- Phase 4 (Schema markup): 8 hours (template creation + implementation)
- Phase 5 (Review campaign): Ongoing (agents handle outreach)
- Phase 6 (Content marketing): 12 hours/month (2 posts × 6 hours per post)

Total: ~95 hours initial build + 12 hours/month maintenance.

## FAQ

**How long did it take to see ranking improvements?**

GMB optimization showed impact within 2 weeks (impressions increased 40%). Landing pages took 6-8 weeks to rank (Google needs time to crawl, index, and evaluate new content). Full results visible at 6 months.

**Did you run paid ads alongside SEO?**

No. This was pure organic SEO. Paid ads (Google Local Services Ads, Facebook ads) would have accelerated lead gen but weren't part of this scope.

**How did you handle duplicate GMB listings?**

Claimed both listings, marked one as duplicate via GMB dashboard, Google merged them within 2 weeks. For stubborn duplicates, contacted Google Support with proof of ownership.

**What was the biggest bottleneck?**

Agent adoption. Getting 14 agents to claim GMB profiles, request reviews, and update photos required persistent follow-up. Solved by assigning one admin to coordinate and track compliance.

**Can this work for non-real estate local businesses?**

Absolutely. Replace "real estate agent" with "plumber," "lawyer," "dentist," etc. The framework is identical: GMB optimization + citations + location pages + reviews + schema.
