# Consulting Statement of Work Template: Scope Definition, Terms, and Protection Clauses

A statement of work (SOW) governs the consulting relationship—what you'll deliver, when, for how much, and under what terms. Weak SOWs create disputes over scope, payment timing, IP ownership, and liability. Strong SOWs protect both parties by defining expectations explicitly and providing mechanisms for handling changes, delays, and disagreements.

This guide provides a complete SOW template with clause-by-clause explanations, customization guidance, and protection mechanisms that prevent common consulting conflicts.

## SOW Template Structure

```markdown
# Statement of Work
[Project Name]

**Consultant**: [Your Name/Company]
**Client**: [Client Name/Company]
**Effective Date**: [Date]
**Project Duration**: [Start Date] to [End Date]

---

## 1. Project Overview

[2-3 sentences describing the engagement at a high level]

**Example**: This engagement covers the design and implementation of a lead scoring and routing system in HubSpot for [Client Company]. The goal is to reduce lead response time from 48 hours to under 6 hours and improve sales team focus on high-intent prospects.

---

## 2. Scope of Work

### 2.1 Deliverables

**Phase 1: Discovery and Design (Weeks 1-2)**
- Conduct stakeholder interviews (3 sessions, 1 hour each: Sales, Marketing, Ops)
- Analyze current lead data and routing process
- Deliver Lead Scoring Model Design Document (10-page PDF) including:
  - 8 fit criteria (company size, industry, role, etc.)
  - 4 intent signals (page visits, email engagement, form submissions, etc.)
  - Scoring thresholds (Hot: 70+, Nurture: 40-69, Marketing: <40)
  - Routing logic recommendations

**Phase 2: Implementation (Weeks 3-4)**
- Configure lead scoring model in HubSpot using approved design
- Build routing workflows (territory-based assignment to 5 AEs)
- Set up sandbox testing environment
- Conduct UAT (user acceptance testing) with client ops team

**Phase 3: Launch and Training (Week 5)**
- Deploy system to production HubSpot instance
- Deliver 1-hour training session for ops team (recorded)
- Provide 2-page Process Documentation (maintenance instructions, FAQs)

**Phase 4: Post-Launch Support (Weeks 6-9)**
- Provide troubleshooting and optimization support (5 hours total)
- Respond to questions via email within 1-2 business days

### 2.2 Out of Scope

The following are explicitly excluded from this engagement:
- Data migration from legacy systems
- Custom API integrations beyond native HubSpot connectors
- Training for end-users (AEs, SDRs) beyond the ops team
- Ongoing support beyond the 5-hour post-launch window
- Design or configuration of email sequences, landing pages, or other marketing assets
- Modifications to Salesforce or other CRM systems

Any work beyond the defined deliverables requires a written change order (see Section 6).

---

## 3. Timeline and Milestones

| Phase | Deliverable | Due Date | Client Action Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------------------|
| Phase 1 | Design Document | [Date] | Review and approve within 3 business days |
| Phase 2 | Configured System (Sandbox) | [Date] | UAT and feedback within 2 business days |
| Phase 3 | Production Deployment + Training | [Date] | Confirm readiness for launch |
| Phase 4 | Post-Launch Support Ends | [Date] | N/A |

**Timeline Dependencies**: Client delays in providing feedback or access will extend subsequent milestone dates proportionally. Consultant will notify Client within 1 business day if a delay impacts the timeline.

---

## 4. Client Responsibilities

Client agrees to provide the following to enable project success:

**Access and Credentials**:
- Admin-level access to HubSpot account within 2 business days of contract signing
- Access to relevant documentation (existing process docs, org charts, tech stack diagrams)

**Stakeholder Availability**:
- Availability for scheduled stakeholder interviews (3 sessions, 1 hour each)
- Designation of a primary point of contact with decision-making authority

**Timely Feedback**:
- Feedback on deliverables within the specified review windows (3 business days for design, 2 business days for UAT)
- Approval or revision requests communicated in writing (email acceptable)

**Environment Readiness**:
- HubSpot data quality sufficient for scoring model (minimum 70% contact completeness on key fields)
- If data quality is below threshold, Client will allocate time for data cleanup or accept reduced model accuracy

Failure to meet these responsibilities may result in timeline extensions or additional fees for rework caused by delays.

---

## 5. Fees and Payment Terms

**Total Project Fee**: $20,000 USD

**Payment Schedule**:
- **Deposit (50%)**: $10,000 due upon contract signing
- **Milestone Payment (25%)**: $5,000 due upon completion of Phase 2 (UAT approval)
- **Final Payment (25%)**: $5,000 due upon completion of Phase 3 (production deployment)

**Payment Method**: [Wire transfer / ACH / Check / PayPal / Stripe]

**Late Payment**: Invoices not paid within 15 days of issuance will incur a late fee of 1.5% per month (18% annually) on the outstanding balance. Consultant may pause work if payment is more than 30 days overdue.

**Expenses**: This fee covers all standard expenses (software, tools, communication). Any extraordinary expenses (travel, third-party tools requiring purchase) will be pre-approved by Client and billed separately.

---

## 6. Change Order Process

Any requests for work beyond the defined scope require a written change order. Change orders will specify:
- Description of additional work
- Impact on timeline
- Additional fees

Verbal requests or email suggestions do not constitute approved changes. Consultant will not begin out-of-scope work until a signed change order and payment (if applicable) are received.

**Example scenarios requiring change orders**:
- Expanding scoring model from 8 to 12 fit criteria
- Adding custom API integrations
- Building additional workflows not specified in original scope
- Training sessions beyond the included 1-hour session

---

## 7. Intellectual Property and Ownership

**Work Product**: All deliverables created by Consultant under this SOW (scoring model design, HubSpot configurations, documentation) become the exclusive property of Client upon full payment of all fees.

**Pre-Existing Materials**: Consultant retains ownership of any pre-existing frameworks, templates, methodologies, or tools used in delivering the work. Client receives a non-exclusive, perpetual license to use these materials as incorporated into the deliverables.

**Portfolio Usage**: Consultant may use the project as a case study (including Client name, results, and process overview) for marketing purposes unless Client requests confidentiality in writing. Client may review and approve case study content before publication.

---

## 8. Confidentiality

Both parties agree to keep confidential any proprietary information shared during the engagement, including:
- Client business data, processes, strategies, and financial information
- Consultant methodologies, pricing, and proprietary frameworks

Confidentiality obligations survive termination of this agreement for [2 years / indefinitely].

**Exceptions**: Confidential information may be disclosed if:
- Required by law or court order
- Already publicly available
- Independently developed without access to confidential information

---

## 9. Warranties and Limitations

**Consultant Warranties**:
- Work will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner
- Deliverables will conform to the specifications outlined in this SOW
- Consultant has the right and authority to enter into this agreement

**Client Warranties**:
- Client has the authority to enter into this agreement
- Client owns or has rights to all data, systems, and materials provided to Consultant

**Limitation of Liability**: Consultant's total liability under this agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by Client. Consultant is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (lost profits, lost data, business interruption) arising from the engagement.

**No Performance Guarantees**: While Consultant will use best efforts to achieve stated goals (e.g., reducing lead response time to <6 hours), specific business outcomes cannot be guaranteed due to factors outside Consultant's control (client team adoption, market conditions, data quality).

---

## 10. Termination

**Termination for Convenience**: Either party may terminate this agreement with 14 days' written notice. Upon termination:
- Client pays for all work completed through the termination date, calculated as: (Milestones completed / Total milestones) × Total project fee
- Consultant delivers all work product completed through the termination date
- All confidentiality and IP provisions remain in effect

**Termination for Cause**: Either party may terminate immediately if the other party:
- Breaches a material term of this agreement and fails to cure within 10 days of written notice
- Becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy

---

## 11. Miscellaneous

**Governing Law**: This agreement shall be governed by the laws of [State/Country] without regard to conflict of law principles.

**Dispute Resolution**: Any disputes arising from this agreement will be resolved through [mediation / arbitration / litigation in [County] courts]. Prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.

**Independent Contractor**: Consultant is an independent contractor, not an employee of Client. Consultant is responsible for all taxes, insurance, and benefits.

**Entire Agreement**: This SOW constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior negotiations and agreements. Modifications must be made in writing and signed by both parties.

**Severability**: If any provision of this agreement is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full effect.

**Force Majeure**: Neither party is liable for delays or failures caused by circumstances beyond reasonable control (natural disasters, pandemics, government actions, network outages).

## Customization Guidance

### Adapt Deliverables (Section 2.1)

Replace the HubSpot example with your specific service deliverables. Be explicit:

**Weak**: "Provide CRM consulting services"

**Strong**: "Configure Salesforce opportunity scoring using 6 fit criteria and 3 behavioral signals, build 3 custom dashboards (Sales Manager, AE, VP Sales), and deliver 90-minute training session"

Specificity prevents scope disputes.

### Adjust Payment Terms (Section 5)

**For smaller projects (<$10K)**: 50% upfront, 50% on completion

**For medium projects ($10K-$50K)**: 50% upfront, 25% at midpoint, 25% on completion

**For retainers**: Monthly recurring payments, due on the 1st of each month

**For enterprise clients**: Net 30 payment terms (invoice due 30 days after delivery)

Match payment structure to cash flow needs and client risk.

### Exclusions (Section 2.2)

List anything clients commonly assume is included but isn't. Examples:

- Training beyond specified sessions
- Data cleanup or migration
- Integrations with third-party tools
- Ongoing maintenance
- Content creation (emails, landing pages)

This prevents "I thought that was included" disputes.

### IP and Confidentiality (Sections 7-8)

**If using proprietary frameworks**: Retain ownership, grant limited license

**If client demands full IP ownership**: Charge 20-30% premium (you're giving up reuse rights)

**If working with sensitive data** (healthcare, finance): Strengthen confidentiality clause, specify data handling procedures (encryption, access controls)

### Liability Limits (Section 9)

Standard cap: Total fees paid. For high-risk projects (financial systems, healthcare compliance), consider professional liability insurance and specify coverage in the SOW.

## Protection Mechanisms

### Change Order Clause (Section 6)

Forces clients to formalize scope additions, creating friction (good friction) that makes them evaluate whether additions are truly necessary.

See [consulting-boundaries-scope-creep.html](consulting-boundaries-scope-creep.html) for enforcement tactics.

### Timeline Dependencies (Section 3)

Protects you from blame when client delays push deadlines. Example: If client takes 7 days to approve design (vs. 3-day SLA), you adjust Phase 2 completion by 4 days.

### Client Responsibilities (Section 4)

Explicitly assigns tasks to clients (provide access, attend meetings, deliver feedback). If they fail, you're not liable for delays.

### Late Payment Terms (Section 5)

1.5%/month late fee incentivizes on-time payment. Pause clause gives you leverage: "Work resumes when payment is received."

### Termination for Convenience (Section 10)

Allows either party to exit. You get paid for work completed, client gets partial deliverables. Prevents hostage situations where one party wants out but contract forbids it.

## Legal Review

This template is educational, not legal advice. Before using:

**Consult an attorney** in your jurisdiction to ensure compliance with local laws (contract enforceability, liability limits, IP rules)

**Customize for your situation**: Industry-specific regulations (HIPAA for healthcare, GDPR for EU clients) may require additional clauses

**Review insurance needs**: Professional liability and errors & omissions insurance provide additional protection beyond SOW terms

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need a separate Master Services Agreement (MSA) and SOW, or is an SOW sufficient?**

For single projects with new clients, an SOW is sufficient—it covers scope, terms, payment, and legal protections in one document. For ongoing relationships with multiple projects, use an MSA (general terms: confidentiality, IP, liability, payment terms) + project-specific SOWs (scope, deliverables, timeline, fees). This prevents renegotiating legal terms for every project. If unsure, start with standalone SOWs and transition to MSA + SOW when you sign a second project with the same client.

**Should I use my SOW template or sign the client's contract?**

Use yours whenever possible—it protects your interests (scope boundaries, payment terms, liability limits). If clients insist on their contract, review carefully for red flags: unlimited liability, IP transfer without full payment, net 60+ payment terms, automatic renewals, non-compete clauses. Redline problematic terms and negotiate. Never sign a client's contract without reading it fully. For enterprise clients, expect contract negotiation—this is normal and doesn't signal distrust.

**How do I handle clients who want to skip the SOW and just "get started"?**

Never work without a signed SOW. Explain: "The SOW protects both of us by defining exactly what's included, when it's due, and how changes are handled. It prevents misunderstandings and ensures we're aligned. I can't start work until it's signed." If they resist, they're either disorganized (risky client) or planning to exploit ambiguity (toxic client). Either way, insist on signed SOW before beginning work. For SOW importance, see [consulting-boundaries-scope-creep.html](consulting-boundaries-scope-creep.html).

**What if a client requests changes to my standard SOW terms?**

Negotiate reasonable changes (adjusted payment timing, specific confidentiality terms, tighter timelines if you can deliver). Refuse changes that expose you to risk: unlimited liability, vague scope, deferred payment until "satisfaction" (subjective), IP transfer before payment. If clients demand unreasonable terms, walk—bad contract terms create bad projects. Protect yourself even if it means losing the deal. For more on client qualification, see [consulting-client-acquisition.html](consulting-client-acquisition.html).

**How detailed should the deliverables section be? Can I be too specific?**

Be as specific as possible without over-constraining your methodology. Specify tangible outputs (documents, configurations, training sessions) and quantify where possible (10-page report, 8 scoring criteria, 1-hour training). Avoid specifying internal process details clients don't care about ("conduct 3 rounds of internal review"). Specificity prevents scope disputes. If clients request "more" of something not quantified in the SOW, you point to the deliverable spec: "The SOW defines 8 scoring criteria. Adding more requires a change order." This protects margin.
