# Pay-Per-Crawl SEO Model: Alternative Pricing for Technical SEO Services

Pay-per-crawl SEO pricing charges for measurable technical improvements—indexed pages, crawl budget optimization, or resolved errors—instead of hourly rates or flat retainers. This model aligns cost with value for sites where indexation and crawl efficiency directly impact revenue. Most SEO pricing is time-based or outcome-vague. Pay-per-crawl ties fees to concrete technical deliverables.

## Why Traditional SEO Pricing Fails Technical SEO Clients

Traditional SEO retainers charge $2K-$10K monthly for undefined deliverables—"ongoing optimization," "content recommendations," "link building." Technical SEO doesn't fit this model. Technical work is project-based, not continuous. You fix crawl errors, optimize site architecture, and implement schema once, then monitor. Charging $5K/month for maintenance that requires 4 hours per month overcharges clients and underdelivers value.

Hourly billing ($150-$300/hour) creates misaligned incentives. Efficient consultants finish faster and earn less. Slow consultants bill more. Clients never know final costs until invoicing. This breeds distrust, especially when technical fixes take unpredictable time—resolving one crawl error might uncover six more.

Outcome-based pricing ("we'll improve rankings") doesn't work for technical SEO. Technical fixes enable rankings but don't guarantee them. A perfectly optimized site with weak content won't rank. Charging for ranking outcomes when you only control technical variables creates disputes.

Pay-per-crawl pricing isolates the technical layer. You charge for indexation improvements, crawl budget recovery, error resolution, and schema implementation—all measurable via **Google Search Console**, **Screaming Frog**, or **Sitebulb**. Clients pay for results they can verify independently.

This model works best for e-commerce, SaaS, and large content sites where indexation directly correlates to revenue. A site with 10,000 pages but only 4,000 indexed is bleeding potential. Getting those 6,000 pages indexed unlocks traffic. Charging per indexed page or per error resolved makes pricing transparent and performance-driven.

## Structuring Pricing Around Indexed Pages

Charge per page successfully indexed or re-indexed. Base rate: $5-$15 per page depending on site complexity. Simple blogs sit at $5/page. Enterprise sites with complex taxonomies and internationalization sit at $15/page.

Audit current indexation status using **Google Search Console**. Run `site:domain.com` in Google to see total indexed pages. Compare that to your XML sitemap count. The gap represents opportunity. If the sitemap lists 8,000 URLs but only 5,200 are indexed, 2,800 pages need work.

Identify why pages aren't indexed: robots.txt blocks, noindex tags, orphan pages (no internal links), duplicate content, thin content, crawl budget exhaustion, or server errors. Fix these systematically, then track indexation improvements weekly.

Pricing structure:
- **Audit phase:** $1,500-$5,000 flat fee. Crawl the site, analyze indexation gaps, deliver prioritized fix list.
- **Implementation phase:** $10 per page successfully indexed after fixes. If you get 1,200 pages indexed, invoice $12,000.
- **Maintenance:** $500/month for ongoing monitoring and incremental fixes.

Set a ceiling to prevent open-ended costs. "We'll get 2,000+ pages indexed for a maximum fee of $20K" caps client risk. If you index 2,500 pages, you still bill $20K. This incentivizes efficiency—the faster you work, the higher your effective hourly rate.

Track indexation via GSC's Index Coverage report. Screenshot before/after states. Clients verify results themselves—no trust required. Payment triggers when GSC confirms indexation, not when you submit fixes.

## Crawl Budget Optimization Pricing

Large sites (50K+ pages) hit crawl budget limits. **Google** allocates a crawl budget based on site authority, server speed, and content freshness. If Google crawls 500 pages/day but your site has 100K pages, it takes 200 days to recrawl the entire site. New pages languish unindexed for months.

Crawl budget optimization reduces wasted crawls (404s, redirects, duplicate pages) and prioritizes high-value pages. Charge for measurable crawl budget improvements: increased crawl rate, reduced wasted crawls, or faster discovery of new content.

Pricing structure:
- **Baseline crawl rate:** Measure current crawl rate via GSC (Crawl Stats report). Example: 450 pages/day.
- **Target improvement:** 30-50% increase in crawl rate or 50% reduction in wasted crawls.
- **Fee:** $0.10-$0.50 per additional page crawled daily, or $5,000-$15,000 flat fee for achieving target.

Example: Site currently crawls 400 pages/day. After optimization, it crawls 600 pages/day. That's 200 additional crawls/day = 6,000/month. At $0.20/crawl, invoice $1,200/month or $3,600 for Q1 (when improvements stabilize).

Optimization tactics:
- Remove crawl traps (infinite pagination, faceted navigation generating duplicate URLs).
- Fix redirect chains (A→B→C becomes A→C).
- Eliminate 404s from internal links.
- Prioritize high-value pages via XML sitemaps and internal linking.
- Improve server response time (reduces time Googlebot spends per page).

Track via GSC Crawl Stats. Before/after screenshots prove performance. Invoice when crawl rate stabilizes at new baseline for 30 consecutive days—this prevents invoicing for temporary spikes.

## Error Resolution Pricing Per Fixed Issue

Charge per resolved technical error—404s, 5xx errors, redirect chains, broken canonicals, missing schema, duplicate content. Flat fee per error type or tiered pricing based on severity.

Pricing tiers:
- **Critical errors** (5xx, noindex on key pages, broken canonicals): $50-$150 per fix.
- **High-priority errors** (404s on high-traffic pages, redirect chains, missing H1s): $25-$75 per fix.
- **Medium-priority errors** (orphan pages, thin content, missing alt text): $10-$30 per fix.

Audit with **Screaming Frog**, **Sitebulb**, or **Semrush Site Audit**. Export error list, categorize by severity, propose fixes with per-error pricing. Client approves scope, you execute, invoice upon verification.

Example proposal:
- 47 critical errors @ $100 each = $4,700
- 214 high-priority errors @ $50 each = $10,700
- 1,200 medium-priority errors @ $15 each = $18,000
- **Total:** $33,400 (offer package discount: $28,000)

Clients can prioritize: "Fix all critical and 50 high-priority errors for $7,200." This modular approach fits budget constraints and proves value incrementally.

Set resolution criteria upfront. "404 is resolved when the URL either redirects to relevant content or is removed from internal links and sitemaps." Vague criteria breed disputes. Clear criteria enable verification.

Track resolutions via follow-up crawls. Screenshot error reports before/after. Clients verify fixes independently—no trust required, only measurable outcomes.

## Schema Implementation and Structured Data Pricing

Schema markup helps search engines understand content, enabling rich results (reviews, FAQs, products, events). Implementing schema across thousands of pages is tedious. Charge per schema type implemented or per page enhanced.

Pricing models:
- **Per schema type:** $500-$2,000 per schema type (Article, Product, FAQ, HowTo, etc.) implemented site-wide.
- **Per page:** $10-$50 per page depending on schema complexity. Simple Article schema = $10/page. Complex Product schema with reviews, offers, and inventory = $50/page.

Audit existing schema with **Google Rich Results Test** or **Schema.org Validator**. Identify gaps: pages missing schema, incorrect implementation, or opportunities for rich results.

Propose schema types that drive traffic or CTR:
- **FAQ schema:** Expands SERP real estate, increases CTR by 20-40%.
- **Product schema:** Enables rich snippets with ratings, price, availability.
- **Article schema:** Qualifies for Top Stories carousel (news sites).
- **HowTo schema:** Enables step-by-step rich results (tutorials, guides).

Implementation process:
1. Template schema in JSON-LD format.
2. Inject via CMS (WordPress plugins, Shopify apps) or site-wide header script.
3. Validate with Google Rich Results Test.
4. Monitor GSC for rich result performance.

Invoice when schema validates and appears in GSC's Rich Results report. Payment tied to confirmed implementation, not effort expended.

Bundle schema with indexation services: "We'll implement Product schema on 2,000 pages and ensure they're indexed: $25K total." This ties technical optimization to visibility outcomes.

## Measuring and Reporting Crawl Efficiency Improvements

Pay-per-crawl pricing requires transparent reporting. Clients need proof of value before paying. Use **Google Search Console**, crawl logs, and site audit tools to document improvements.

Key metrics to track:
- **Indexed pages:** GSC Index Coverage report. Screenshot before/after counts.
- **Crawl rate:** GSC Crawl Stats. Track pages crawled per day over 30-day periods.
- **Wasted crawls:** Calculate percentage of crawls hitting 404s, redirects, or blocked URLs. Target <5%.
- **Crawl budget efficiency:** (Indexed pages / Total crawled pages) × 100. Target >80%.
- **Error reduction:** Export error reports from Screaming Frog or Semrush. Show before/after counts by error type.

Build a dashboard that updates weekly. Use **Google Sheets** with GSC API integration or a BI tool like **Looker Studio**. Clients access real-time data—no waiting for monthly reports.

Report structure:
- **Executive summary:** Total pages indexed, crawl rate improvement, errors resolved.
- **Detailed metrics:** Broken down by page type, error category, or site section.
- **Trend analysis:** 12-week charts showing indexation growth or crawl rate improvements.
- **Next steps:** Prioritized list of remaining issues or optimization opportunities.

Transparency eliminates payment friction. Clients see results before invoices arrive. Trust is replaced by verification.

## Hybrid Models: Combining Crawl-Based and Retainer Pricing

Pure pay-per-crawl works for initial optimizations but struggles with ongoing work. Hybrid models balance project-based crawl pricing with maintenance retainers.

**Model 1: Project + Maintenance**
- **Phase 1 (project):** $20K to fix crawl errors, optimize indexation, implement schema. Duration: 60-90 days.
- **Phase 2 (maintenance):** $1,000/month ongoing monitoring, quarterly audits, incremental fixes.

**Model 2: Performance Tiers**
- **Tier 1:** Index 500-1,000 pages = $8K
- **Tier 2:** Index 1,000-2,500 pages = $18K
- **Tier 3:** Index 2,500+ pages = $35K
- **Maintenance:** $500-$1,500/month based on site size.

**Model 3: Success-Based Retainer**
- **Base retainer:** $2,000/month covers ongoing work.
- **Performance bonus:** $10 per 100 pages indexed beyond baseline. If you index 800 pages in a month, invoice $2K + $80 = $2,080.

Hybrids prevent client churn. Pure project work ends, and clients leave. Retainers provide recurring revenue. Performance bonuses incentivize continuous improvement.

Define maintenance scope clearly: monthly crawls, GSC monitoring, quarterly audits, priority fixes (< 2 hours/month). Anything beyond scope triggers per-error or per-page fees. This prevents scope creep while maintaining flexibility.

## When Pay-Per-Crawl Pricing Works vs. When It Doesn't

**Works best for:**
- Large sites (5K+ pages) with indexation issues.
- E-commerce sites where every indexed product page = revenue.
- Sites migrating platforms (re-indexation critical post-migration).
- Clients burned by retainers with vague deliverables who want measurable outcomes.
- Technical SEO specialists who want to differentiate from content-focused agencies.

**Doesn't work for:**
- Small sites (<500 pages) where indexation isn't the bottleneck.
- Content marketing clients who need ongoing production (charge retainer for content, pay-per-crawl for technical).
- Clients prioritizing link building or brand authority over technical optimization.
- Projects requiring extensive strategy, research, or content work beyond technical fixes.

Assess fit during discovery. If the client's primary issue is "our best content doesn't rank," pay-per-crawl won't solve that—it's a content quality or authority problem. If the issue is "our 10,000 pages aren't indexed," pay-per-crawl is perfect.

## Legal and Contractual Considerations for Performance Pricing

Performance-based pricing requires clear contracts. Define success metrics, measurement methods, and payment triggers explicitly.

**Contract clauses to include:**
- **Baseline metrics:** "Current indexation: 4,200 pages per GSC as of [date]." Attach screenshots.
- **Success criteria:** "Success = 6,500+ pages indexed within 90 days, verified via GSC Index Coverage report."
- **Measurement method:** "Indexation measured via Google Search Console data export, verified by client."
- **Payment trigger:** "Invoice issued when GSC shows 6,500+ indexed pages for 7 consecutive days."
- **Force majeure:** "Provider not liable for indexation delays caused by Google algorithm updates, manual actions, or client-side technical changes."
- **Refund terms:** "If success criteria not met within 120 days, client receives 50% refund of project fees."

Use escrow for high-value projects. Client deposits funds into escrow, funds release when success criteria are met. This protects both parties—client doesn't pay until results appear, provider doesn't work without payment assurance.

Include audit rights: "Client may audit work via third-party technical SEO consultant. If audit confirms success criteria met, client pays audit costs. If audit disproves success criteria, provider pays audit costs and refunds fees."

Avoid guarantees around rankings or traffic—those outcomes depend on factors beyond technical SEO (content quality, competition, brand authority). Guarantee only what you control: indexation, crawl efficiency, error resolution.

## FAQ: Pay-Per-Crawl SEO Pricing

### How do you prevent clients from disputing indexation numbers?

Use GSC as the source of truth. Both parties access the same GSC account and verify metrics independently. Screenshot GSC reports on payment trigger dates. Include verification method in the contract: "Indexation measured via GSC Index Coverage report > Indexed pages count."

### What if Google de-indexes pages after you've been paid?

Include a stability clause: "Payment triggers when pages remain indexed for 14 consecutive days." If pages drop out before 14 days, you continue working until they stabilize. This protects clients from temporary indexation that disappears.

### How do you price for sites with millions of pages?

Use tiered pricing with caps. "First 10,000 pages @ $10/page = $100K. Next 40,000 pages @ $5/page = $200K. All pages beyond 50,000 included at no additional cost. Total cap: $300K." This prevents absurd invoices while rewarding efficiency.

### Can this model work for local SEO or small business clients?

Rarely. Local SEO focuses on rankings, citations, and reviews—not indexation. Small business sites (<100 pages) rarely have technical issues complex enough to justify pay-per-crawl pricing. Stick with flat project fees ($2K-$5K) or small retainers ($500-$1,500/month).

### What tools do you need to track performance for this pricing model?

**Google Search Console** (indexation, crawl rate), **Screaming Frog** or **Sitebulb** (site audits, error tracking), **Google Sheets** or **Looker Studio** (dashboards), **GSC API** (automated data pulls). Total cost: $0-$500/year depending on tool stack.
