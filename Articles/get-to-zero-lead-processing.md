# Get to Zero Lead Processing — Daily CRM Discipline for Sales Teams

**Get to Zero** (GTZ) is a CRM discipline where sales teams process every new lead to a decision state daily. Zero doesn't mean empty inbox—it means zero uncontacted leads, zero unanswered questions, zero ambiguous next steps. Every lead receives human attention within hours, not days. Every conversation advances to a scheduled action. Every dead lead is marked closed, not left rotting in "Contacted" stage.

The methodology originated in real estate, where speed-to-lead determines conversion. A prospect who fills out a home valuation form and gets a call in 15 minutes is 10x more likely to convert than one who waits 24 hours. In B2B, the dynamics are similar: a CFO researching fractional consultants who gets a thoughtful reply in 2 hours forms an impression of responsiveness that persists through the entire evaluation.

Most sales teams don't have a lead problem. They have a **lead processing problem**. Leads pile up in CRM because no one owns daily triage. Reps cherry-pick hot prospects, ignore lukewarm inquiries, and assume "I'll get to it later." Later never comes. Leads decay. Conversion rates plummet. The solution isn't more leads—it's GTZ discipline.

## The Core Principle: Decision States, Not Holding Patterns

Traditional CRM stages are **holding patterns**:

- "New Lead" (uncontacted)
- "Contacted" (we called once, no answer)
- "Nurture" (vague future opportunity)

These stages describe limbo, not progress. GTZ replaces holding patterns with **decision states**:

- **Contacted Today** (attempted contact within 24 hours)
- **Qualified** (two-way conversation, need identified, next step scheduled)
- **Appointment Set** (meeting on calendar)
- **Dead** (explicitly disqualified or unresponsive after 3+ attempts)

Every lead moves to one of these states daily. No lead sits in "New" for 48 hours. No lead languishes in "Contacted" for a week. If a rep can't advance a lead, they mark it "Dead" and free capacity for viable prospects.

**The forcing function:** At end-of-day, the only acceptable CRM state is **zero leads in "New" or "Uncontacted."** Everything else is processed to a decision state.

## The Daily GTZ Workflow

**Morning (30-60 minutes):**

1. **Review overnight leads** — check CRM for leads that arrived since yesterday's close
2. **Prioritize by source and intent** — referrals first, web forms second, cold portal leads third
3. **Contact high-priority leads immediately** — call, text, or email within 1 hour of inquiry

**Midday (15-30 minutes):**

4. **Follow up on morning outreach** — if no response, attempt second contact via different channel (called in morning? Text at midday)
5. **Advance qualified leads** — schedule appointments, send resources, answer questions

**End of day (30-45 minutes):**

6. **Process remaining leads** — call/email every uncontacted lead from today
7. **Mark dead leads** — if 3 attempts with no response, mark "Dead - Unresponsive"
8. **Schedule tomorrow's follow-ups** — set CRM tasks for leads needing next-day action

**The non-negotiable rule:** End each day with zero leads in "New Lead" stage. If you can't contact 100% of new leads daily, you're receiving more leads than your capacity can handle. Solution: reduce lead sources or hire more reps.

## Speed-to-Lead: The 5-Minute Rule vs. The 1-Hour Standard

Research shows the **5-minute rule**: contact leads within 5 minutes of inquiry for maximum conversion. Reality: most teams can't sustain this. Reps are in meetings, on calls, or handling existing clients.

**The compromise: 1-hour standard**

Contact 90%+ of new leads within 1 hour during business hours. This is achievable with:

- CRM mobile app notifications
- Zapier automation (new lead → SMS to agent)
- Lead rotation (distribute new leads to available reps, not specific territories)

**Measurement:**

Track **average speed-to-lead** per rep and per source. Example metrics:

- Rep A: 18-minute average
- Rep B: 4-hour average

Rep B needs coaching or capacity reduction. Rep A demonstrates GTZ discipline.

**Source performance:**

- Referrals: 12-minute average (reps prioritize these)
- Web forms: 45-minute average
- Zillow leads: 3-hour average (reps deprioritize third-party leads)

If low-quality sources (Zillow) consistently get slow response, either stop paying for them or reassign to a dedicated rep.

## Smart Lists: Automating GTZ Accountability

**Smart Lists** are dynamic CRM filters that surface leads requiring action. Build these lists to operationalize GTZ:

**1. Uncontacted Leads (Top Priority)**

- Stage: "New Lead"
- Created: Last 24 hours
- No activities logged

**Goal:** This list should be empty at end of day.

**2. Hot Prospects (Last 30 Days)**

- Stage: "Qualified" or "Appointment Set"
- Last activity: < 30 days
- Not tagged "Dead"

**Goal:** Every lead in this list has a scheduled next action (call, meeting, proposal).

**3. Nurture (30-90 Days)**

- Stage: "Contacted" or "Qualified"
- Last activity: 30-90 days
- Not tagged "Dead"

**Goal:** Touch these weekly (email, text, or call) to prevent decay.

**4. Appointment No-Shows**

- Stage: "Appointment Set"
- Appointment date: < 7 days ago
- No subsequent activity

**Goal:** Immediate re-engagement attempt. No-shows who aren't followed up within 24 hours rarely convert.

**5. Stale Leads (90+ Days, No Activity)**

- Last activity: > 90 days
- Stage: Not "Dead" or "Closed"

**Goal:** Mark as "Dead" or move to long-term nurture. These clog your CRM and distort pipeline metrics.

Reps start each day processing Smart Lists in order: Uncontacted → Hot Prospects → Nurture → No-Shows.

## Team Accountability: Public Scorecards and Manager Oversight

GTZ only works with **accountability mechanisms**. Without enforcement, reps revert to cherry-picking hot leads and ignoring the rest.

**Daily scorecards (visible to entire team):**

| Rep | New Leads | Contacted % | Avg Response Time | Appointments Set |
|-----|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Alice | 12 | 100% | 22 min | 4 |
| Bob | 15 | 87% | 1h 15min | 2 |
| Carol | 10 | 100% | 8 min | 5 |

**Metrics tracked:**

- **Contacted %** — percentage of new leads contacted same day (target: 95%+)
- **Avg response time** — time from lead creation to first contact (target: <1 hour)
- **Appointments set** — qualified conversations leading to scheduled meetings
- **Dead rate** — percentage of leads marked dead after 3 attempts (benchmark: 30-50%)

**Manager review protocol:**

Daily 10-minute standup:

1. "What's your Uncontacted count?" (Should be zero)
2. "Show me your top 3 Hot Prospects and their next steps."
3. "Any leads stuck in Contacted for 7+ days?" (If yes, why?)

Weekly one-on-one:

1. Review full pipeline, identify bottlenecks
2. Audit "Dead" leads to ensure proper disqualification
3. Celebrate wins (high contact rates, fast response times)

**Consequences for non-compliance:**

- Failure to GTZ 3 days in a row → coaching session
- Persistent failure → lead allocation reduced (prove you can handle 10 leads/day before getting 20)
- Refusal to adopt GTZ → performance improvement plan

This sounds harsh. It's necessary. Uncontacted leads represent wasted marketing spend and lost revenue. Non-compliance is a performance issue.

## Multi-Touch Sequences: What to Do When They Don't Respond

GTZ doesn't mean "call once and give up." It means **systematic follow-up** across multiple channels over 7-14 days.

**Standard 7-day sequence for unresponsive leads:**

**Day 1:**
- 9am: Phone call (leave voicemail)
- 11am: Text message: "Hi [Name], I called earlier about [inquiry]. When's a good time to chat?"

**Day 2:**
- 2pm: Email: "Wanted to follow up on your inquiry. Here's [resource] that might help. Available for a call this week?"

**Day 3:**
- 10am: Phone call (no voicemail if already left one)

**Day 5:**
- 9am: Text: "Still interested in [topic]? If timing isn't right, no worries—let me know if I should follow up later."

**Day 7:**
- 3pm: Final email: "Haven't heard back—assuming timing isn't right. I'll check in again in 90 days unless you'd like to connect sooner."

After Day 7, mark "Dead - Unresponsive" and move to 90-day nurture sequence (automated monthly emails).

**Vary channels:**

- Call → Text → Email → Call → Text → Email

Different people prefer different channels. Phone-averse prospects respond to texts. Email-averse prospects answer calls.

## Disqualification Discipline: Marking Leads "Dead"

Most reps hate marking leads "Dead." It feels like admitting failure. This psychological barrier causes pipeline bloat—thousands of zombie leads that will never convert but clutter reports.

**Dead lead categories:**

1. **Unresponsive** — 3+ contact attempts, no reply (50% of dead leads)
2. **Not a fit** — budget too low, outside service area, wrong timing (30%)
3. **Went with competitor** — explicitly chose another provider (10%)
4. **Bad data** — invalid phone/email, unable to reach (10%)

**Why marking dead matters:**

- **Pipeline accuracy** — inflated pipeline misleads forecasting
- **Capacity allocation** — reps waste time on dead leads instead of viable ones
- **Conversion metrics** — accurate dead rate helps evaluate lead source quality

**Reactivation protocol:**

Leads marked "Dead - Timing" can be reactivated if they re-engage (reply to nurture email, fill out new form). Leads marked "Dead - Not a Fit" or "Dead - Bad Data" should not be reactivated.

**Manager audit:**

Monthly review of "Dead" leads to ensure reps aren't prematurely disqualifying:

- Check dead leads with <3 contact attempts (should be escalated back to active)
- Review "Dead - Not a Fit" reasons (are reps disqualifying based on assumptions vs. conversation?)

## Measuring GTZ Success: KPIs and Benchmarks

**Leading indicators (daily/weekly):**

- **Uncontacted lead count** — should be zero at end of each day
- **Average speed-to-lead** — target <1 hour during business hours
- **Contact attempt rate** — % of new leads receiving 3+ contact attempts within 7 days (target: 95%+)

**Lagging indicators (monthly):**

- **Lead-to-appointment conversion rate** — % of new leads that schedule meetings (benchmark: 15-30% for B2B, 5-15% for third-party real estate leads)
- **Dead lead rate** — % of leads marked dead after 3 attempts (30-50% is normal; <20% suggests poor disqualification discipline; >60% suggests low lead quality)
- **Pipeline velocity** — average days from "New Lead" to "Closed Won" (track by source to identify delays)

**GTZ vs. non-GTZ performance:**

Teams implementing GTZ typically see:

- **+40-60% increase** in lead-to-appointment conversion
- **-50% reduction** in average response time
- **+25-35% increase** in closed revenue from same lead volume

The improvement comes from processing every lead systematically vs. cherry-picking.

## Common GTZ Implementation Failures

**1. No manager enforcement**

Reps won't self-enforce GTZ. Managers must review scorecards daily and coach non-compliance.

**2. CRM friction**

If logging activities requires 5 clicks and 2 minutes, reps won't do it. Simplify: use CRM mobile app, voice-to-text notes, or Zapier automation.

**3. Lead volume exceeds capacity**

If reps receive 30 leads/day but can only process 15, GTZ fails. Solution: hire more reps, reduce lead sources, or implement lead scoring to prioritize.

**4. No consequences for non-compliance**

If reps ignore GTZ with no repercussions, adoption collapses. Link performance reviews and bonuses to GTZ metrics.

**5. Over-rotation to speed vs. quality**

GTZ isn't about speed alone. A 5-minute response that's generic and robotic converts worse than a 45-minute response that's personalized and helpful. Speed + quality wins.

## FAQ

**What if we get leads outside business hours?**

Automate immediate response (SMS or email: "Thanks for reaching out, I'll call you first thing tomorrow morning") and contact within 1 hour of start of next business day.

**How do we handle high lead volume (100+/day)?**

Implement lead scoring (assign points for source, behavior, demographics) and route high-score leads to sales reps, low-score leads to automated nurture sequences. GTZ applies only to scored leads.

**Should we GTZ cold outbound leads?**

Yes, if you're doing outbound at scale. Every prospect who responds (email reply, answered call) should be contacted same-day. Unresponsive prospects after 3-5 attempts get marked "Dead" and moved to long-term nurture.

**What's the difference between GTZ and Inbox Zero?**

Inbox Zero processes email to decision states (respond, defer, delete). GTZ processes leads to decision states (qualify, schedule, disqualify). The principles are identical; the domain is different.

**How long does it take to build GTZ discipline?**

2-3 weeks of daily manager oversight. Most teams see metrics improve within 7 days if accountability mechanisms are enforced.
