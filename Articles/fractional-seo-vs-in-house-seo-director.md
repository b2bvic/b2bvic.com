# Fractional SEO vs In-House SEO Director — When to Hire Which

**The decision:** Your company needs SEO leadership. Traffic is flat, content strategy is reactive, and technical debt is accumulating. Do you hire a full-time SEO Director at $140K-$200K+ annually, or a fractional SEO consultant at $60K-$120K annually for part-time strategic oversight?

The answer depends on four variables: **company stage**, **SEO maturity**, **execution capacity**, and **strategic complexity**. A $50M company with a 10-person marketing team has different needs than a $3M company with one marketing generalist. The fractional model works when you need strategy and architecture more than day-to-day execution. The in-house model works when SEO is a core growth lever requiring dedicated leadership.

Most companies default to full-time because it feels "serious." This is expensive signaling. A fractional SEO director delivering 15 hours/month of focused strategy often produces more value than a full-time hire spending 30% of their time in meetings, 20% on administrative tasks, and 50% on execution work that could be delegated.

## Cost Comparison: True Total Cost of Ownership

Salary is only part of the equation. Full-time employees carry overhead that fractional consultants don't.

**Full-time SEO Director (mid-market company):**

- Base salary: $160,000
- Payroll taxes (7.65% FICA): $12,240
- Benefits (health, 401K, insurance): $25,000-$40,000
- Recruiting costs (20% of salary): $32,000 (one-time)
- Onboarding and ramp-up (3 months lost productivity): ~$40,000 opportunity cost
- Equipment and software: $5,000/year
- Management overhead (time spent in 1-on-1s, reviews): ~10 hours/month from VP/CMO

**Total first-year cost:** $274,240+ (salary + taxes + benefits + recruiting + equipment)

**Ongoing annual cost (years 2+):** $202,240 (salary + taxes + benefits + equipment)

**Fractional SEO Consultant:**

- Monthly retainer: $7,500 (15 hours/month at $500/hour equivalent)
- Annual cost: $90,000
- No benefits, no taxes, no recruiting costs, no management overhead
- Can terminate with 30 days' notice (vs. severance + replacement costs for full-time)

**First-year savings:** $184,240 (68% lower)

**Ongoing savings:** $112,240/year (56% lower)

The cost delta funds execution resources: a content writer ($60K), a technical SEO specialist ($70K), or agencies for link-building and content production.

## Capability Comparison: What Each Model Delivers

**Full-time SEO Director strengths:**

1. **Deep institutional knowledge** — learns company, product, customers, and competitors intimately
2. **Day-to-day tactical execution** — can manage content calendar, conduct audits, optimize pages
3. **Team integration** — attends all meetings, collaborates cross-functionally with product, sales, support
4. **Reactive capacity** — available for urgent issues (algorithm updates, technical emergencies)
5. **Ownership mentality** — long-term incentive alignment via equity, bonuses, career growth

**Fractional SEO Consultant strengths:**

1. **Strategic expertise** — brings patterns from 10-20 past clients, avoiding beginner mistakes
2. **Specialized skills** — deep technical SEO, programmatic SEO, enterprise migrations (skills rare in generalist hires)
3. **Vendor network** — relationships with freelancers, agencies, and tool providers (accelerates execution)
4. **No ramp-up time** — delivers value from week one (vs. 3-6 month onboarding for full-time)
5. **Objectivity** — not influenced by internal politics, delivers unfiltered recommendations

**Where full-time excels:**

- Companies with 5+ person marketing teams needing daily coordination
- Product-led growth models where SEO strategy shifts rapidly with product changes
- Content-heavy operations (100+ articles/month) requiring daily editorial oversight
- Enterprise SEO (10K+ pages, complex technical architecture) needing constant monitoring

**Where fractional excels:**

- Early-stage companies (seed to Series A) building SEO foundation
- Companies with existing execution teams (content writer, web developer) lacking strategic direction
- Turnaround scenarios (traffic collapsed, need diagnosis + recovery plan)
- Project-based needs (site migration, technical audit, content strategy design)

## Decision Framework by Company Stage

**Seed/Pre-revenue ($0-$2M ARR):**

**Choose fractional.** You don't need full-time SEO leadership. You need foundational strategy: keyword research, site architecture, content roadmap, and basic technical SEO. A fractional consultant delivers this in 10-15 hours/month for 6-12 months, after which you have a blueprint for execution.

**Budget allocation:**

- Fractional SEO: $5K-$7K/month (strategy)
- Content writer (freelance): $2K-$3K/month (execution)
- **Total:** $7K-$10K/month

**Series A/Early Growth ($2M-$10M ARR):**

**Choose fractional initially, transition to full-time at $5M+ ARR.** At this stage, SEO is growing from experiment to revenue driver. You need strategic oversight and process buildout, but day-to-day execution can be handled by contractors or junior hires under fractional guidance.

**Budget allocation:**

- Fractional SEO: $7K-$10K/month (strategy + team oversight)
- Junior SEO specialist: $60K/year (technical execution, content optimization)
- Content team (writers, editors): $5K-$8K/month
- **Total:** $17K-$23K/month

Transition to full-time when SEO drives 30%+ of pipeline and requires daily strategic decisions.

**Growth Stage ($10M-$50M ARR):**

**Choose full-time.** SEO is a core growth lever. You need someone embedded in product, sales, and content operations daily. A fractional can't provide the integration depth required.

**Budget allocation:**

- Full-time SEO Director: $160K-$200K/year
- 2-3 person SEO team: $180K-$300K/year (technical, content, link-building)
- Agencies/contractors: $5K-$10K/month (specialized execution)
- **Total:** $50K-$70K/month

**Enterprise ($50M+ ARR):**

**Choose full-time + fractional for specialized projects.** Your full-time SEO Director runs day-to-day operations. Bring in fractional experts for specific initiatives: international SEO expansion, programmatic SEO buildout, enterprise migration, or algorithm recovery.

**Budget allocation:**

- Full-time SEO Director: $200K-$300K/year
- SEO team (5-10 people): $500K-$1M/year
- Fractional specialists (as needed): $10K-$20K/month project-based
- **Total:** $75K-$150K/month

## Execution Gap: Fractional Requires Supporting Cast

The biggest fractional failure mode: hiring a fractional SEO consultant without execution resources. Strategy without execution is expensive advice that goes unimplemented.

**Fractional SEO success requires:**

1. **Content production** — writer(s) to execute content strategy (in-house or freelance)
2. **Technical implementation** — developer to execute technical recommendations (in-house, agency, or Upwork)
3. **Project management** — someone to track deliverables and hold execution team accountable (marketing coordinator, ops manager, or fractional themselves)

**Example breakdown for $10K/month budget:**

- Fractional SEO: $6K/month (12 hours strategy + oversight)
- Content writer: $3K/month (4-6 articles)
- Developer: $1K/month (Upwork, 5 hours technical fixes)

This produces more value than a $10K/month full-time hire who splits time between strategy and execution poorly.

## What Full-Time SEO Directors Actually Do (Time Allocation)

Most companies over-index on strategy and under-estimate execution drag. Here's typical time allocation for a full-time SEO Director:

- **Strategy and planning:** 20% (8 hours/week)
- **Meetings (standup, cross-functional, leadership):** 25% (10 hours/week)
- **Execution (writing, optimizing, auditing):** 30% (12 hours/week)
- **Administrative (reporting, documentation, tool management):** 15% (6 hours/week)
- **Professional development and firefighting:** 10% (4 hours/week)

Only 20% of a full-time hire's time is spent on high-leverage strategic work. The remaining 80% is execution and coordination—work that doesn't require $160K/year expertise.

A fractional consultant's time allocation:

- **Strategy and planning:** 60% (9 hours/month out of 15)
- **Team oversight and QA:** 30% (4.5 hours/month)
- **Client communication:** 10% (1.5 hours/month)

The fractional model concentrates time on strategy, delegating execution to lower-cost resources.

## Hybrid Model: Fractional for Strategy, In-House for Execution

Many companies deploy a hybrid: fractional SEO consultant for strategy, junior in-house SEO specialist for execution.

**Roles:**

**Fractional SEO Consultant ($7K-$10K/month, 15-20 hours):**
- Keyword research and content strategy
- Technical audits and prioritization
- Link-building strategy and outreach coordination
- Monthly reporting and strategic recommendations
- Hiring and training junior SEO

**Junior SEO Specialist ($50K-$70K/year in-house):**
- On-page optimization (titles, metas, schema markup)
- Content briefs and editorial calendar management
- Technical SEO fixes (page speed, crawl errors, internal linking)
- Analytics tracking and reporting
- Coordination with developers and content team

This structure provides strategic expertise + execution horsepower at $17K-$20K/month total cost—comparable to one mid-level SEO Director, but with deeper expertise and faster execution.

## When to Transition from Fractional to Full-Time

Indicators that fractional SEO is no longer sufficient:

1. **Execution bottleneck** — fractional can't provide enough hours to oversee growing team and workload
2. **Strategic frequency** — SEO strategy needs weekly iteration, not monthly (common in product-led growth)
3. **Cross-functional integration** — SEO impacts product, sales, and support daily; requires embedded leadership
4. **Competitive pressure** — competitors with full-time SEO leaders are outpacing you

**Transition playbook:**

1. Fractional helps write job description and hiring criteria
2. Fractional interviews candidates (expert evaluation)
3. Fractional onboards new hire (1-2 month overlap)
4. Fractional transitions to quarterly advisory (5 hours/quarter for strategic reviews)

This preserves institutional knowledge while scaling to full-time capacity.

## Risk Mitigation: What If You Hire Wrong?

**Fractional risk:**

- **Lower financial risk** — 30-day termination, no severance, no recruiting costs
- **Reputation risk** — choosing wrong fractional delays SEO progress 3-6 months

**Full-time risk:**

- **Higher financial risk** — $50K-$100K sunk cost (recruiting, onboarding, severance) if wrong hire
- **Opportunity cost** — 6-12 months lost if bad hire doesn't perform and you start over

**Mitigation strategies:**

**For fractional hires:**
- Request case studies in your vertical
- Check references from at least 3 past clients
- Start with 3-month trial engagement before annual commitment

**For full-time hires:**
- Use fractional consultant to screen candidates (expert evaluation)
- Probationary period (90 days) with clear performance metrics
- Equity vesting over 4 years (reduces turnover risk)

Fractional hiring is lower-risk because exit costs are minimal. Full-time hiring requires more diligence upfront.

## FAQ

**Can a fractional SEO replace a full-time director indefinitely?**

For companies under $10M ARR, yes. Beyond that, full-time integration becomes critical. Some enterprises keep fractionals as ongoing advisors (5-10 hours/month) while full-time directors run operations.

**What happens if the fractional consultant leaves?**

Document everything: strategy decks, audit reports, process SOPs. Store in shared drive (Google Drive, Notion). This creates continuity. Request 60-day offboarding period to transition knowledge to internal team or replacement.

**How do I evaluate fractional SEO consultants?**

Ask: (1) Case studies in your vertical? (2) Technical SEO depth (not just content strategy)? (3) Execution support (do they have writer/developer network)? (4) Reporting cadence and format? (5) Termination terms?

**Can I hire both fractional and full-time?**

Yes, for specialized roles. Full-time generalist + fractional technical SEO specialist or programmatic SEO expert. Avoid overlap—clarify who owns strategy.

**What if my company is too small for either?**

At <$1M ARR, use agencies or freelance SEO specialists ($2K-$4K/month). Fractional makes sense when SEO complexity exceeds what generalists can handle but doesn't justify $160K/year.
